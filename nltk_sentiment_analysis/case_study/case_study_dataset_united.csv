Hi @united my bags were put on a different plane today and were supposed to be delivered to my house this evening and still have not arrived.
@united just told me it would cost $75 for them to switch the order of my flights in the App so we could check-in.... no actual changes to the flights, just the order in their system 😂
@united Have been trying. Currently on hold again with UA. Transferring me to baggage in Newark I think. She has 6 months worth of medication she needs in that bag and all her clothes!!
@united 1 if I didn’t pee, 3 if I did sleep enough 😇
@united So proud of young man. #GoBlue 〽️🔵💛
@united None of the above. These are all awful choices for someone who’s 6’3” - and just for the accident of genetics, people like me are forced to pay extra just to avoid being in actual, physical pain. Nothing “fun” or “whimsical” about this tweet. 😠
@united I just sent a DM. Thank you for your help.
@united was so brutal to deal with in the states and then we got to Canada and the attendants are so sweet and helpful and it’s just such a flip in attitude and efficiency wow.
I think my favorite part of flying @united &amp; trying to get my suitcase back was having the baggage services place me on hold to “call EWR”... only to find out i had been waiting 30 minutes to be transfered to reservations.
@united Literally none of them. Add more leg room and stop making us pay for basic ass comfort
@united ORD baggage claim is ridiculous. Landed over 30 min ago and not a single bag yet. The airport is empty did everyone go home already?
@united hell of a day for 20 y.o. daughter traveling by herself to another country! Was on tarmac over an hour while her connection left without her (to Madrid). Your staff at Newark was rude (remember this is a 20 year old girl)! Now bag has not shown up to new airline! HELP!
@united If y’all just got your act together in general it would be helpful I think. ty
@united Now we are sitting on a Bus with no plane in sight. Not enough room for everyone to sit and no explanation of What is going on!
@united It does. Part of it is operated by Lufthansa
@united Best seat is When you get to enjoy 1, 2 and 3 😀
@united but any issues are dealt with poorly - traveling is stressful, when problems arise, they should be dealt with with kid gloves - not just endless apologies (there’s actually nothing more annoying), but true action to alleviate the stress 2/2
Again disappointed by @united meals on domestic. In premium plus this time &amp; still no gluten free option except the sugary"select"box.I'm paying for a meal on my ticket. At the very least should get other comp for airport food or decent dinner option. It's not a choice to be gf
@united Which one doesn't come with a beating?
@united after 7 hours of sitting in the airport, multiple flight delays, a flight cancellation, and a re-booking, I find out my bag never made it on the plane. Wtf.
@united over 2 hours on phone tonight with poor customer service. As member of ur frequent flyer program, I’m very disappointed.
@united 3 - least interaction with other people. (I rarely use airplane bathrooms)
@united Ugh. Thank you for the clarification. I mistakenly assumed there was better communication between the various agencies. I’ll try contacting the airport lost and found directly.
@united 3, especially on a widebody
I often complain about the airlines, but a big thanks to JC from the @united Twitter team who fixed a problem for me today that it’s agents at SFO couldn’t.
@united 2, as long as you have the row to yourself... otherwise it’s gotta be #1.
@united SCAM! I payrd for a checked bag. Never got a recipt confirmation nor does it come up with my confirmation number!!
@united Unfortunately, all three options end up with my knees wedged up against the back of the seat in front of me unless I pony up for at least economy comfort 😒
Dear @united, we are disappointed that our bags including car seat didn’t make it our UA864 flight to SNA. Not excited about waiting until the next flight lands in SNA late this evening to get our luggage.
@united I just wish the United gate agent in Pittsburgh had been willing to contact the gate agent in Newark that evening. Or that we didn’t forget it in the first place.
@united Depends on the flight, but lately I’ve been taking the window on my flights between ORD and GRU.
@united Yes, I made the report on that site. Won’t they connect with the Airport lost and found to see if they have it? How else would they locate it? I reported exactly where it was left behind (women’s bathroom near gate c107) and when (12/27 5:30pm).
never fly with @united they canceled my flight and tried to make me go to another airport an hour and a half away. they ended up refunding my money but now i have to wait 7 days to get it back and now i’m freaking out trying to find a whole other flight to florida before monday
@united Always seat 3 for me. 💺✈️. See you in the spring United!!
I have had my suitcase missing since last night. Have spoken to multiple agents who have assured me over and over my bag will be delivered and yet NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. @united this is the worst customer service I could ever imagine.
@united elevator not working in United club. That is why this is #worstairline
@united announced boarding of UA 2323 even though incoming flight had not reached gate. Sneaky united pretending flight not 2 hours late to avoid compensating passengers. #worstairline #customersbedamned
@united Long haul #1. Domestic #3
@united Still no plane in Newark after 3 hours without any information. Come on!
So not only was my flight delayed and I nearly missed my connecting flight but @united also sent my luggage to the wrong location 🙃 Never again!!!
@united And, I kid you not, we have to pull over on the highway because the back door wasn't properly locked and opened...
@united I’m on Flight UA463 from ORD to DCA.
@united Thank you! Happy New Year!
@united We reported it missing but sadly we haven’t been reunited with the pillow yet. I have visions of it just sitting in a lost and found pile. Is there anything else I can do?
@united you run THE worst airline in America. You people need to step it the fuck up.
@united Thank you; I'm traveling for a funeral so I appreciate any help in getting the bag as fast as possible.
@united No, because I'm not in Allentown yet, and the representative at Newark told me I have to wait until I arrive there without my bag.
@united The one where you DON’T break wheelchairs &amp; harass SD handlers, &amp; think a $50 flight voucher is the answer when you do.
@united why do you have flights on your website that aren't able to be booked 😢
@united That sounds serious. It’s safe to fly?
Sit for over an hour on the @united shuttle bus from EWR to ABE waiting for luggage. Luggage finally delivered, but guess whose bag is missing? Finally driving now, but guess my suitcase will come tomorrow?
@united Hi. My boyfriend is trying to get through to you/pet safe to discuss his flight tomorrow but he’s been on hold for 2 hours now and hasn’t managed to speak to a representative. Any idea on how he can get through to speak to someone as it is a matter of urgency
Never flying @united again. ‘rebooked’ flight is set to get us home nearly 24 hours after scheduled arrival. The ‘customer service’ agent refused hotel or meal vouchers. No gate agent as promised. Was reminded I paid for basic economy 3x’s. $850 for 2 dtw to rsw- not a deal.
@united 36 out of 68 scheduled flights from Newark after 8pm delayed. 25 out of 36 delayed flights due to United airplane or crew issues. #worstairline
@united DM sent. Hope to hear back and thank you for responding to my tweet. Very much appreciated.
@united Trying to book discounted travel flights w/app and use a travel voucher that I received after a flight cancellation in Europe but the app doesn't give me an option to even use this voucher. What do I do?
I’m watching this game on mute because I’ve been on hold for an hour with @united
@united currently delayed on one of your planes and the captain said there was a leak and it was because it “wasn’t serviced”. Luckily he caught it during his, “walk around” but like... what the hell? Y’all just out here not doing routine checks?
@united no i was wrong, a fuel "leak" (a waterfall of jet fuel) and forcefully ejecting a passenger with extreme force, to giving away a child's seat, did they get their money back? i don't know if they did, i wonder how you haven't gone under from the ammount of lawsuits!
@united #3 if you with family #1 if you by yourself
@united remember when you killed a puppy? yea fuck you because of your lack of training to ensure this didn't happen, for you shall never live it down.
@united I sat in the middle seat coming back from PA and the person in the window seat smelled like she bathed in onions. The woman in the aisle seat was beautiful, smelled good and was cool to talk to tho so the situation evened itself out.
.@united What do I gotta do to get that sweet 1K status? I'll do a Michigan J. Frog song and dance for you guys?
@united Seat 1: advantage, one leg can be stretched out into the aisle. Disadvantage, the same leg can be run over by the service cart
Had a delicious soba noodle salad on the plane ride - easy to put together - mixed greens, grated carrot, red cabbage, white onion, grilled chicken, soba noodles, balsamic vinaigrette. Might make it to this week’s #Mealprep #cookingforcalm @united
@united 3 if flight is less than 4 hours. 1 if flight is more than 4 hours. 2 only if husband is in 1 or 3.
@united shout out to lost and found baggage staff at SFO. Found and returned my MacBook which I left on board. So grateful and thank you to all who helped get it back to me! 🙏🏻
@united Thank you. I genuinely believe a simple recommendation to add the KTN in the email confirmation will go a long way. I appreciate you listening to what I have to say.
Id say i wish terrible things for you but you already work at houstan @united
Dear houstan @united man, i literally could not hate you more
@united I mean, they clearly aren't able to process all the requests. I appreciate the recommendation but I recommend you put this disclaimer in the email confirmation you send. I shouldn't have to have this conversation to know about latency issues.
UPDATE: there is a @united flight departing my gate to my destination BUT not my flight 🙄
@united I have DM additional details regarding the overall experience. Kindly revert
Fyi @united in houstan is extremely rude and unhelpful they made me miss my flight due to sheer assholery
@united 3,1. 2 only exists when flying with family!
@united 3, near the wing, if possible.🤞
@united Why even offer the ability to add my KTN at the airport if your system has too much latency to support the proper user experience?
My least favorite thing about @united is the fact that they don’t enforce the FAA regulations of no passengers getting up while we are on a taxiway. UA1517
I got a live person again and @united hung up !!
@united Since it's United, guaranteed answer is get off that plane!!!!
@united Mr Coley, You are a great ambassador as well as a valuable asset to United Airlines. “Going Above and Beyond!” Great job United Airlines and Mr Coley-!-!-!
Idk what I’m yelling at more the pats or @united
@united 1! 3 makes me feel like I’m gonna fall out of the plane
I’ve been on the phone or hold for an hour now @united
shoutout to @united for the WORST travel experience of my life
@united Been waiting on this tarmac for an hour since you’re backed up at EWR. Everyone around me just missed their connecting flight. Only two updates from the captain in an hour. Ridiculous.
An Indian friend booked a flight home from Morocco with a layover in Montreal. As she was checking in was notified she would need a transit visa for Canada, just for a few hour layover! A visa for a layover! @united won’t refund her flight despite their lack of notification...
@united Any seat from 40years ago... Before you took away all the leg/arm room, only to cram more seating onto all your airplanes, only looking to make more profit! While we’re at it...if a 747 can carry a space shuttle? I call Bullshit on baggage fees for any airplane!!!
@united I’m filing a complaint with the BBB this is atrocious customer service
Hi, @united , any chance for some kind of compensation for a 6 hr delay on UA1708 ORD to MSP this AM? The FA told us upfront to contact you guys.
@united I arrived SHV 3 days ago from IAH, reported my checked bag missing, called daily since, still no bag, what the actual fuck?! Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced!!!
@united Is there some kind of explanation for why UA4929 went from being delayed to 10pm then to 9pm then to 9:34pm and then to 10:14pm? I’m only hearing that it’s delayed but not why or how a plane that is in the air can do that.
@united Controversial (yet honest) question: should overseized clients be allowed to seat in the middle?.
@united Upgrade me to business for my trip so I don't have to be number 2
You know what’s fun, sitting at an airport less than 2hrs from home waiting for a 30min flight home - for 4+ hours. It’s one thing to get a delay, but with 5+ delays for a 30 min flight - we all could have rented a car and driven there and back twice now. Thanks, @united.
@united I do! I’ve talked to 3 people it was supposed to be here at 5pm the lasted then 7pm the latest then 10 mins ago with the latest representative. I will send you the file number privately
@united 1 All day, err day
@united finally made it to BTV on flight UA 682 after ORD delays to learn our luggage had been lost. While dealing with claims, learned a man’s wheelchair had been lost, same flight. At the time we left agent desk they still weren’t willing to let him borrow an airport chair! 🤬
@united hey how do you book a flight on the Star Wars plane???
@united Why do you load FOUR planes on one carousel? Other carousels aren’t even moving? Poor management of the entire United hub right there. Who’s watching out for your customers? All we do is WAIT for this airline. #unitedsucks
@united #CustomerService . Can’t believe I am $3 short on 2019 PQM and they didn’t give me next status level. Those $3 were lost on canceled flights.... # dotherightthing
@united I’m to poor so it doesn’t matter
. @united 2019 and we don’t have live tv in all of our cross country flights yet? Some of us have sports to watch. Disgraceful. If my mom didn’t book most of my flights I’d take my business elsewhere!!
@united Delay at Dulles. Flight 2022. Waiting in line no update was supposed to board at 7:20 and still waiting with no update. App doesn’t even provide details. What’s going on?
@united my ski bag is missing still ITS BEEN 26 HOURS! It took 36 hours 6 days ago. WTF
@united just left my 80 yr old mother at Dulles airport to fend for herself after a cancelled flight to Germany. What the hell happened to customer service? Instead you leave an 80 yr old dragging 3 suitcases through the airport frantically looking for a flight by herself! WTF
@united flight 5004 now 7.5 hours delayed half of which due to United specific issues with pilots. I will be filing a chargeback with my credit card provider
@united I’ll never fly united again I’m about to pee in my pants thanks a lot I could have went during the 40 MINUTE WAIT
Thank You @united for helping me work thru the seat selection order problems I was having. As well as the generous resolution. I appreciate you going the extra mile..Yhanks again!
@united I have to pee and while we sit here I should be allowed to go we aren’t in the air we aren’t taking off we are on park I need to go I am in pain
@united Please tell them I’m going to pee myself if I can’t go my bladder literally hurts
@united 1 unless I need to sleep...I like getting up without bothering anyone!
@united Thanks I just filed a claim hoping to hear back from you soon.
@united 3!! I love watching the world down below, and trying to figure out where I am.
@united If #3 doesn’t align with a window, then #1
@united 2172 I just need to use the restroom and we aren’t moving but they won’t let me go pee like so quickly I’m 100% I’ll be done before we start moving
If I piss myself it’s on @united for delaying my flight and not letting me use the restroom while we sit here on the plane not moving not flying legit in park
Shit ass airline @united was supposed to take off 30 minutes ago and we are sitting on the runway and I can’t go to the restroom WE’RE NOT EVEN FUXKING GOING ANYWHERE
@united Window seat is ta the best one
@united None of them because the legspace is trash 🗑! !
@united If we answer, you’ll charge us more for the more popular one, so no
@united You guys have consistently,without missing a beat, delayed my flights for hours,causing missed connections and all the inconvenience that comes with it,today I'm here and it has happened again! I have to try again tomorrow, No reasons given at all #dissappointedmuch
How bad is @united customer service
#boycott @united 12 hours later - finally at my destination an NO GATE #poorcustomerservice #getmeoutofhere
Unreal @united I have never had such a horrible experience with flying. And do you think you can find a real person to talk to on the phone to get some help? Never again.
@united Thank you! Good flight tonight ☺️
@united caught myself a nice gastro virus after eating at your SFO Club just before a 14h flight to Australia. How about some basic hygiene at your food outlets? #shitvomitfly
@united I love the window seat myself... The rake-off &amp; landing.... Works the best when vlogging my travels..
@united 1 always. 3 only of 1 and 2 are unoccupied
@united how can I file a claim for a delayed flight which resulted in 2 missed flights, lost baggage, no food and a very unpleasant experience with a newborn?
. @united never ceases to amaze me with how bad they are when it comes to customer service. I wish I had a recording of this call I’m on right now that I could post on here. Crazier is that part of this call has to do with how bad they handled a few situations yesterday.
@united I find it ridiculous that I cant check in online because I have Basic Economy and I'm not checking in a bag. So now I have to allow more time to travel when I clearly understand that I can only have a smaller carry on that fits underneath my seat.
Flew with @united last night only to find out that more than half of our flight was missing luggage that we checked in 2 hours prior to the flight! Best part? The rude and tired baggage service associates who “forward” the messege back to EWR.
@united 3 always, 2 never ever
@united a heartfelt fuck you from all the passengers of flight 5004!
@united 3 always... have a fear of flying, but watching the clouds keep me calm
@united On a jet blue airplane
@united whichever one you dont rip people out of
@united Whichever one actually is comfortable for normal people and my long-legged family members and not squished like a sardine in a row. A window and aisle depending on your needs.
@united Window seat is always the best seat for me! I am flying sitting in the window seat today as usual!!!
@united One always for us taller guys!
@united no meals on a 10.5 hour flight is ridiculous and unacceptable. Our tix coat over $1100 each and no meal
@united worst experience in a while at the gate in HNL. Paid for priority boarding and gate agent denied me
@united Literally NEVER 2! The worst in any row...and because that person has the worst seat....they get the arm rests on both sides
hey fuck you @united been waiting 2 hrs for my bag when my flight was cancelled at 4:45
@united Thanks for the reply btw 👍
@united I think I’m hoping for DirecTV
@united How about one with a civilized amount of leg room, instead of one that caters to your investors and board.
@united 1 for more leg room and snacks
Shout to the guy at the ticket counter for @united for having them wait for me bc I was running late
@united Seat one and shout out to Mariana Cisneros the best employee ..I love you!
@united It was disappointing to get an email today that so that I could use my laptop to watch movies on my United flight tomorrow. You might want to edit that so people are not disappointed when they get to the airport.
@united I was able to get through; I spoke to Rose on the disability desk and she was FANTASTIC. Thank you so much for responding, as well. I feel very taken care of 🥰
@united Doesn’t mention live TV 😖
@united on a plane in Austin heading to Washington D.C. VERY hot in plane and strange noises coming from front. 13 minutes past takeoff time and were still sitting here at port with no word from anyone. Can we get a little communication please?
@united 1 for short flights, 3 for long flights. SEAT 2 GETS BOTH ARMRESTS PEOPLE!!!
@united All of them so I can lay down
@united 1 and 3 are great when you don't sell seat 2 to a person so large they spill over into them.
okay @united but now another hour was wasted because i was told my bag didn’t get on the plane when i was just rebooked. waited over a hour for them to tell me it’s not here anymore😫 #imdone
@united Can you get me upgraded for my inconvenience
@united In planes it is the window seat, bar none. ✈
@united Do you have a time estimate as to what time we wil board again?
@united Already have and the resolution was less than satisfactory. Next step is filing a complaint with the FAA
Great to see that @united has no idea how to manage baggage claim. Denver flight 789 to Boston arrives on time but everyone has been waiting over an hour for luggage!
@united #3. There are no other acceptable answers.
I want to praise the crew on @united flight 648 from Den - Pit today. We had a medical emergency and had to take an unscheduled stop. They treated the sick passenger with extreme care and communicated really well with the rest of the passengers on the flight.
@united There was no response to the last DM.
@united will you have live sport on a flight from Chicago to London? Checking for next weekend’s big NFL games!
@united 3 if you want to sleep! 1 if you want to stay awake and watch movies!
@united I am on flight UA 628 from pbi to ewr what is the status update
@united One more question — is there a physical card with the subscription, or does United not have physical Club Access cards anymore?
@united We landed. Are you going to hold the plane or no?
I encourage everyone not to fly @united #horrible
@united WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS!!
Zero response is exactly what I should have expected from @united, yet I stupidly got my hopes up that they'd try to make it right.
@united So you separated me and my husband for a straight man with his wife and 2 kids. Thanks
@united We just made a reservation for a flight on March 18 with a $250 voucher and paid for the flight in full. The voucher credit doesn't show up. Our credit card was charged the full cost of the flight. Confirmation number is BYCLKP. Please help!
Today my flights included @united 265 DEN-SNA &amp; I want to say Andrea in the First Class cabin was really wonderful! She is very kind, gracious &amp; engaging. Her warm demeanor made us feel very welcomed. She’s a stellar example of excellent customer service. 👍🏼
@united 3 with 1 and 2 empty
@united any seat is good when you’re non reving
Agent response in United club,”we can’t really help passengers because Newark is a busy airport. Tough luck”. Way to go #worstairline @united
@united All y’all bashing option 2, but when you was young and traveling with your parents, it was by far the best one for getting some quality sleep in
@united once again proves why it’s the worst airline ever. Missed connecting 3pm flight to Boston because UA 65 was delayed by 1 hour. Then UA 2323 delayed by 90 mins due to flight prep
@united can you please help me. I went to try to change my seat alignment and now im in a much worse boarding group. Didn’t even change it.
So 5 hours in Baltimore wasn’t enough time to refuel flight 5017 - we had to divert a 2nd timr to Philly!??? this flight took off out of STL at 7:45 CT what more @united are you going to out us through?? Almost 12 hours for a 1:39 min flight!!! #youarehorrible #faa #foxnews ##cnn
@united And flight credit to come back and spend the time with my family that I’ve lost.
@united Yes, I’ve lost a day and a half due to delays and I want to take a later flight on Sunday.
I irrationally love @united ... except for the fact that this is the second international trip my partner and I have taken when they inexplicably cancel all of one of our reservations 😔
@united 1. You get to the bathroom with less human interaction and no "sorry", "excuse me", "can I pass?"
@united As a Gold member and million miler why am I no longer eligible for complimentary upgrades? Just checked in for my flight and I am no longer on the wait list. Is this the new Mileage Plus plan? It seems like the airline is only interested in those with the highest standings.
@united Also been on hold with your customer service for over 30 minutes.
@united 4138, 4486, 4071 (today) and tomorrow 1615 and 5971...
Just flew from Chicago to St. Louis to do a college basketball game tomorrow on NBC. Got off of the flight on @united and dropped my headphones. Amazing flight attendant named Shannon tracked me down in baggage claim to give them to me. Thank you Shannon!!
@united He’s in line to get his luggage tag changed.
@united You guys have been really great today, thank you.
@united Thanks. Can we get an update by Monday please? By now I assume the plane has been cleaned and if anything was recovered would be logged, right?
I will never fly @united ever again. I am now spending my second full day at the airport due to (non-weather) delays. I also have a flight out at 7AM tomorrow that I probably won’t make. I fly very often and this is by far the WORST experience I’ve ever had! 😭
@united I need help. I am a traveler w a disability and I just got disconnected from the call center. I did not get a call back. We have a serious family emergency and I can not tie up the phone line. Please help?
@united Just waiting to hear from him about whether he’s actually booked.
@united Since Antwerp is his final destination, that’s a good flight.
@united None, anything on another airline.
ok @united had to deplane after sitting for over two hours. and now being rescheduled for tomorrow. annoying yes. but hey, get another night with family!! even when things don’t go the way you plan, still find a way to be grateful. it could always be worse.
@united Sub 2 hours window! Over two hours aisle.....hopefully only middle if it’s E+!
@united It looks like someone has him on a flight to Brussels; we’re all scrambling.
@united 1 or 3, 2 if you’re a psycho 😂
@united Flying back to Phoenix. Enough seat in your waiting areas would be nice.
@united 1 all the way, aisles are the way to go!
@united My favorite seat isn’t mentioned, what number should I put for the left seat?
@united Are you going to compensate me for the time wasted? the reschedule of everything and everyone's time? The customer Care, told me the next flight is the next day. i booked a ticket for 7 days not 6. I have to go to the meeting without rest, sleep and jet lagged
@united Is this a trick question so you can jack-up prices on “best” seat?
@united Flight tomorrow. I have never been able to get video playback working. Let’s say fresh windows 10 install, no browser, no flash installed, no security settings. What do I download to watch a movie on my flight tomorrow, where do I download it? Flash 29 is 2 years old
This is so annoying @united, my flight today got delayed 1 hour. So i will miss my connecting flight. That was also booked through united. if i didnt call the support, i'd would have been stuck in Denver for a day. so ?, friend left work to drive me to the airport, meeting missed
@united He keeps getting bounced back and forth between UA and LH.
@united My fav is deffo 3! Flight always go longer when you can't see the amazing scenery!
@united You all have said that for days. No work has been done. You all don’t care. Your promises are empty and useless.
@united Window! How do you record video of takeoffs and landings from the aisle? 😁 🛫🛬
@united literally been sitting on runway for almost 2 hours- literally about to miss my connecting flight
@united why are you copying low cost airlines with your basic economy policies. I mean, at least you can show us what seat I have been given. Going to the United representative at an airport is a waste of time. I’m gonna need to reconsider my commitment to United in the future.
@united It’s the UA flight that’s at issue; it still hasn’t left ORF.
@united Window seat in the exit row. Views plus you can usually get out without disturbing your seat mates too much.
@united I'm going to ask you one more time. What is the identification of the airplane that blew up a little bit of smoke? Media wants to know. Is it in flight? On a personal note, does the money a plane brings override a lawsuit?
@united 1. I don't mind having to get up for others, and I hate feeling like I'm bothering people when I go to the restroom.
@united None of the above. I would prefer the Flight deck.
@united The best seat is any seat on a United flight because you all do such an amazing job and I appreciate you.
@united Never 2; unless you're a tiny person, or you're flying with family who won't complain about you spilling over.
@united 1 during the day 3 at night
@united So I'm conversing with an algorithm correct?
@united I'll ask the gentleman in my purchased seat what his disability is and get back to you. I'm certain that you separated us bcvwe are a gay couple. Prove me wrong.
@united my flight 2020 4/11/2019, Buenos Aires- miami. They made us wait 10 ha in Houston, they gave you 10 dollars for food and I lost my first day of vacation
id on't know if it's possible to track who the last person i talked to via @united - but if it is, please let her know that she literally made my year. THANK YOU!
@united At this point, any seat on a plane that actually takes off
@united RA that was the most useless conversation I have ever had and the only reason I’m not posting screenshots is because they include a photo of my face with a RUG BURN on it after irresponsible actions by YOUR airline
@united This is unacceptable. You all are not working well enough or fast enough. It has been three days. I want my luggage on the next flight
@united what is the identification of the plane with a little bit of smoke as you described it? I have the media hounding me.
@united He’s currently being told he can’t get to Amsterdam until Monday; he’s meeting up with a school group. Any help you can give would be appreciated.
@united 1 for freedom, 3 for sleeping ;)
@united 3, window is headrest Zzzzzzzzz
@united I'm still waiting for my refund or repayment for the wait and the day lost in my destiny
@united I'm a medical professional, stick to what you know. This is not the first time you have separated us and I'm sure it won't be the last. I'm here ony because my husband is 1K flyer.
Stuck on a 4+ hour @united flight with a broken screen. Can ur girl get a voucher or something bc this is garbage.🙄
@united Rabbits are fragile creatures. Please, for their safety, allow them to travel IN the cabin as they have been allowed until recently!
Please nobody book a flight with @united airlines. There's not a good chance, but a better chance to crash with them.
@united Be great if you could fix delays instead of new planes...
@united is utter trash. Guess who STILL HAS NOT GOTTEN HER LUGGAGE? They asking for time and patience about something that I have paid for and not received after 3 days. For some reason everyone else luggage is more important. This is going to get escalated
Just took the new @united flight from SFO-DEL and it was a breeze. We got a good flight path and made it in 14.5 hrs!
@united what is your customer service number ?
@united Usually 1. But 3 on transcon red eyes. Leaning on bulkhead is more comfy.
I cannot even describe what just happened on my @united flight but let’s just say I got stepped on and $2k in vouchers were gifted. I did not get a voucher.
@united 1 if you have a short connecting flight, 3 if it’s a straight flight. Never 2 unless you know the people next to you.
@united I don't see anyone on this flight with a disability.
@united 1 💺 For my long legs
@united Very true! Nothing beats that view!
Why does @united continue to separate me and my husband from each other after our seats have been confirmed? Is it because we are a same sex couple?
@united 1 so I can get my soda faster
@united 3 for sure. Love looking out of the window during the flight!
@united 3 as long as the rib between the windows isn’t against your shoulder
@united Today's my birthday! It would be great if you guys can send a birthday tweet? 😍
@united If I have checked in but opted out of putting myself on the upgrade list is there a way I can change my mind?
@united Doesn’t he have 1.5 hours?
.@united the flight attendants on flight UA3530 are doing a terrible job. We are on an active taxiway and are allowing people to stand up and move around. We can't take off because they are BRUTAL at their jobs.
@united The one with the IFE. Oh.. wait. #PaxEx
@united Under 3 hours, #3. Over 3 hours, #1
@united Is there a number he can call? Or a person to email?
@united I’m really hoping that doesn’t mean paying for baggage again in IAH...any help there?
@united for an easy flight, 1. for a beautiful flight, 3. for a nightmare flight, 2
@united please have your ground crew in Memphis get it together. Sitting here waiting for over 30 min to pull into an open gate. Ridiculous #alwaysslowhere
@united super stressful checkin at MBJ, manual enter passports only to be told to go to counter, printed wrong boarding pass only to go back after reaching security, agent only willing to check bags (6) to connecting city IAH and not final destination.
@united Sigo esperando una respuesta sobre las 8 horas de demora en Houston de mi vuelo 2030 y los ridiculos boucher de 10 USS para que almorcemos 😤
@united 4. (Getting dragged down the aisle)
@united what is the issue with 1482. Is the plane broken or what? Can we at least get on the plane for some AC?
@united at your request I have filled in the forms you sent me after you extended our 2 hour flight to a 27 hour travel day!three days later when can I expect a response?I understand you probably have many complaints,I am patiently waiting.....
@united Because of the time change we can’t figure if the flight is 1.5 or 2.5 hours.
@united to move a family of five with an autistic child and a child in a boot that that had pre selected their seats months ago would be bad service. To do it twice is piss poor service. All of us seperated is not an option. Need to cancel our reservation and make other plans.
@united does united ever have a successful flight. You suck!
@united what's the deal with 1482 STT to EWR. Getting no information here.
@united 😂he’s not on either, but I’ll ask; what time should he land in Chicago and how much time does he have to make it?
@united Depends. Overnight - 3. Blaster &gt; Flight length 3. 1 - When you don’t sleep and the flight attendants slam you with the cart. 2 - When 1 &amp; 3 are both very attractive people.
@united My mom got a call saying that it was en route to our house. Thank you very much for replying and trying to help.
@united Not very many people picking the “friendship” seat!
@united my wife left her iPhone on UA 620. Departed HNL at 11:56pm on Thursday 1/2/20 and arrived in SFO Friday 1/3/20 at 6:15 am. We have submitted an online form yesterday but no word yet! Please help!!!
@united Aisle every time. Too claustrophobic for the others!
@united thanks. That isn't a confirmation number, it is the name of the EU regulation which entitles customers to $600 compensation if their flight is delayed over 4 hours when flying from an EU country. Thanks again!
@united Well seeing as you bumped me off my non stop, I don’t think priority boarding is much to ask
Seriously @united ??? You put us on a plane with a dent in the fuselage, deplain everyone, bump my 75yr mother-in-law and myself to a next day flight, don't seat us together (which I paid extra for).. AND THEN don't so much as offer a voucher???
@united The one on the Delta Flight
@united can you tell me what’s going on with flight 3762? Son’s got a flight LH9155 out of Chicago to Amsterdam; does he need to reschedule?
@united Hi there, my flight on 2nd Jan from Berlin Tegel to Reagan (DC) was delayed by 5 hours, missing my connecting flight (Newark) &amp; train home. V disruptive. Can you let me know if there is a form / formal procedure to claim the compensation under EC261? Thank you.
@united How about boarding earlier on my next leg? UA704
@united Always the aisle. There’s nothing worse than having to wake up two total strangers so that you can go to the bathroom. UGH! 😂
@united It seems odd to pay additional and board in group 4. Nearly had to check my bag
@united 1 if it’s first or business, 3 economy or more than 2 hrs.
@united explain to me please why I board in group 4 when I have economy plus ticket ?? UA1632
@united I am very angry, my sisters were not allowed to board their flight back to Nigeria from the US because y’all were asking for Yellow Fever Vaccine. Please when did this start? They are Nigerians and came for a 2 weeks vacation. This is really annoying ....
@united need your help. I left my laptop on flight #2166 from ORD to SFO. I filed a lost item report and someone be my hero. I have a huge presentation on there that I finished on the plan.
@united And I’m sure you were of no help to her son just as you’ve been no help to us. It’s a shame that you’re aware of your poor customer service and choose not to do anything about it. #donotflyUnitedAirlines #UnitedAirlines #dontfly
@united We are stuck in the Fort Wayne airport parking lot because of a SWAT situation... are flights being held here?? Really want to get home...
.@united has stroopwaffles on their flights and this is all i needed to know to make them my airline of choice
@united 1, just in case there is a crash you will be safer in the seat of number one. Option 3 would suck you out of the window. Option 2 you would probably be sucked out as well with option 3. Option one you would be able to going to a crouching position in the middle of the aisle
@united Since onboard head injuries come from falling luggage I’ll take the window
@united whichever one reclines and lets me sleep. the window seat is better because you can use the inside of the fuselage as a pillow holder. i love sleeping on airplanes.
@united another baggage fail at DEN. Over 30 minutes to get “priority” bags out to the carousel. Getting to be the worst all-around customer service in industry.
@united 3 for good head support and personal hand rest so that I don’t have to wrestle with 2. 1 is good for stretching legs and frequent use of toilet. I always prefer 3 though.
@united Your system separated my girlfriend and I. Don't place us on different flights.
@united my family and I have been taxiing to the runway for about 2 hours on flight UA5896. Are you guys going to hold the connection to LGA flight UA1274 ??? Great weather, don’t understand the delay out of ASE.
@united Top airlines to fly other than United: any airline, any airline, any airline, any airline, any airline.
@united Please go out of business.
@united Seat 3 I love the window seat I’m a future pilot for United
@united After 100ish United flights over the last year and a half, I’ve decided to switch to Delta for 2020. Too inconsistent. Terrible service. Your service center employees are about as useful as Walmart greeters
My flight was scheduled for 12:20. 2:20, still haven’t got off the ground. Can y’all PLEASE just get me home tonight? Like, I’ve had my flight rescheduled already today and I’m gonna miss my second connector. @united PLEASE.
@united 3 with out a doubt.
People talk bad about @united airlines but I think there great. Never had a bad flight ✈️ looking forward for my next trip to Hawaii 🤙🏻
@united Flight number 4950. It seems that we should not have taken off to begin with for the sake of safety and the passengers should not have been ignored.
@united Oh and we are just sitting on the tarmac knowing that the storm won't pass for another hour.
@united thanks for the 3 hour delay. Trash ass airline.
@united None, because ya jammed 10 more rows on the plane, and no seats have leg room
@united Probably going to miss the connection too
@united UA3530 to CLE UA3433 to ORD leaving at 5:55
Anyone want to have a bad day? Just book a @united flight. They’re handing out free bags of misery with every ticket.
@united Sitting next to my lovely wife, any seat is good 🤗😉
@united As mentioned your gate agents are doing nothing! #useless #worstcustomerserviceever
@united Window seat is the best !!!
@united Very disappointed with customer service at PDX ticketing counter. Refused to assist or contact a supervisor.
.@united incoming flight to rsw was delayed because of your delay and now a ground stop because we missed our departure window. 1k member not happy!
@united Extremely disappointed EWR flight 4950. After over an hour of delay, Passengers tried to get the attention of the attendant for a loud bang and were ignored. We took off anyway and with Smoke in the walkway we landed after 15 minutes in the air. We should be compensated.
@united It’s not letting me submit it saying I don’t have all the fields in “personal information” filled out but I do. I’m at a loss.
@united Focus on what’s important. My most recent United delay (one of many): 3 hour delay for a 45 minute flight because one of your flight attendants didn’t show up. Missed connection so tried to get bag back - 4 hours to bring bag from plane to baggage claim.
Nice surprise - United upgrade for flight to Tokyo- thanks @united
@united Yes. I’ve been waiting over 40 minutes to have a ticket verified with a confirmation number
@united Really. Maybe I should post that reply. Waiting on explanation as to why our 2 bags were picked. We were in different reservations. Also you should teach your staff about environmental issues. They wouldn’t refill my daughter water bottle. They insisted on giving plastic cups.
Of course the one time I have a checked bag it doesn’t make it. Wtf @united missing an afternoon of skiing🖕🏻
@united No matter the seat as long as I fly United for m'y vacation in the US from France 😉
@united 1 for long flights and 3 for shorter ones.
@united Gate agents here are doing nothing!! And we have been here for over 3 hours no lunch vouchers!
@united I could sure use your help. My rush bag has gone missing - never arrived at its destination and is unsearchable online. Any way you can help me find it?
@united Seat 1 for sure, can easily get out to use the restroom when the seatbelt sign is off. Which is usually for around 10 minutes for each 1 hour of flight time. :-).
@united Less than 2 hours, or more than 6, seat #3 is my first choice, otherwise seat #1 is my choice. Seat #2=Never!
Nothing like climbing 4 flights of stairs with 120 pounds of luggage to avoid missing your connection because @united choose to have their hub at the steaming garbage pile that is EWR. Welcome to the US for valued international visitors and returnees.
Serious question. Does @united have a corporate initiative to torment their customers? I mean, so they put their staff through special training to equip them to provide such utterly piss poor service, or is it just their incompetence? Literally any airline would be better!
Massive @united failure on arrival at the global embarrassment that is EWR. No bag recheck available after customs. Told to hand carry bags to terminal c. Except escalator to air train is broken and line for elevator is 200 yards long. Oh and bags took 40 mins to arrive.
@united I am trying to start my vaca and get out of newark! Been on the plane since 10:30. Understand delay with fog but then pilots timed out...and now what’s they delay. #wholedaywasted #flightua1449 #ridiculous #badservice
@united I have four flights with United this week from Edmonton Canada YEG, all in seat 1!
@united have tried 4x to get an email verification of used ticket. Called three times and they said it would come in 24hrs. Requested online once. It hasn’t come and it’s been a week. Help!
@united 1 is the best seat!!!
@united I can’t talk to anybody to file anything.
@united 3 so I can watch the ground crew &amp; see the clouds &amp; landscape
@united My bag was delayed or lost or whatever last night. Flew to OKC from DC, bag didn’t make it. Tracking number comes up with nothing. Waited on hold for 20 minutes to talk to someone in bagging services. Getting very upset, I want my things and am worried. No one is helping me here.
@united sat up here and lost my bag. This is truly some ghetto shit.
@united For the aviation lovers 3 for the people with long legs 1 and for the people who don’t give a shit... 2
@united So ready just need the cash 😂😂
@united The ones where you give people more than 2 inches of legroom... so none? Would be nice of any airline worked on that instead of seeing passengers as sardines with wallets..
Fuck @united 🤬 this has been the worst airport experience and we aren’t even on the plane yet. Tsa was great but bag check and trying to get on the plane is total mess. No one looks like they know what they are doing.
@united The middle seat could be made more accommodating by making the headrest frame a persons head and retractable shoulder and leg rest do you can lean on a part of the chair instead of the persons to your left or right and and a leg rest list on wheel chair to end feet in aisle probs
Hoping @united has #NFL on this flight to #Tokyo I don’t wanna miss the next 13 hours of #football!
@united The best seat is the one in you can fit without sticking your knees outside. Your seats are designed for 5’4 tall people.
Only @united could consistently deliver such horrible cringeworthy constantly late service. A case study for companies looking to make their customers miserable on every interaction
@united It doesn't matter, they are all very uncomfortable.
@united Can I assume it won’t be fixed by tomorrow? Is there any workaround so that the flight home might be better?
@united 1. I hate climbing over people to use the restroom.
@united you are the reason I drink
.@united delayed three times back to back for no reason!!! and all you have are these bullshit generic text messages. Worst. Airline. On. The. Planet. #warning to other passengers: do not fly United. You will regret it every time.
@united is THE worst airline in America. Do. Not. Fly. United.
@united just landed and they told us our bags are coming in on a later flight. Very inconvenient considering we arrived to the airport to check our bags early and our bags were tagged as priority. 😓
@united 1 end of debate for me, unless you sleep then 3 as no disturbance. No good can come of the middle seat.
@united 3. I love the window
@united Thank God I traveled to &amp; from Philadelphia safely, for the holidays. With the threat from the recent killing; there's sure to be retaliation. 😲 I won't take ANY form of mass transit
@united 1 love an aisle seat. I get up a lot during a flight
@united the aisle, from there i just get up and go to the bathroom.
.@united another flight, another unexplained drag, another set of apathetic and utterly unconcerned gate agents. Seriously I hope United goes bankrupt...again. Terrible experiences every time. Be warned people - do not fly United!
@united 3 on late flights or 1 on ones where I don’t want to sleep
@united If you're me... Seat #1. I have long legs, and most seats on United have my knees into the seat/tray in front of me.
@united The left side one in the cockpit.
@united Any seat that can get me to the destination
@united The 737-700 from Puerto Plata has not a one that isn't first class. Ugh. Worst 4 hours on a plane of my life.
@united 3. No one climbs over me!
@united Very soon. In fact we shall be seeing each other quite often this 2020.
@united I was wondering if I can use my travel voucher that was given to me from your company and use it on a different airline? United has been such a bummer to be working with, and so expensive!
@united 1. almost always the aisle on long haul economy.
I say this every time I fly, but after today’s events, I will go to the ends of the earth to never fly @united ever again. So thankful my returning flight isn’t with them
Hey @united how do I get money back for a 7 hour flight delay
@united when I asked a customer service rep about my item on my return trip, their response was a sarcastic "😬😬😬 good luck". So apparently it's known and expected that passenger's items just "disappear"?
@united In a heartbeat, I will take 3
@united It's now been 14 days since one of your gate agents phoned me to tell me they were turning in my lost item to lost and found labeled with my name and phone number. I hope whoever took my item home instead of returning it to me enjoyed their "surprise" present.
@united Are you asking in order to determine how much more to increase your already absurd seat choice fees? If so, then 2 is the best. Godspeed.
@united 3 for redeyes, 1 for everything else.
@united Is this basic, economy, or economy plus? Just wondering how much I need to pay to sit where I want...after purchasing a ticket.
@united I usually go for 1 (more shoulder room and I don’t like being penned in) but on shorter flights in Economy Plus I’ll sometimes pick 3 to look out the window. I recently had an exit row to myself (like winning the lottery) and I scooched from 1 to 3!
@united I would like to report an insensitive employee at your ticketing counter at the C gates at EWR who made check-in a living hell... even going as far as discriminating against our US citizenship wrongly assuming that we were not citizens because of our accents.
@united my sister paid in advance for her checked bag but was charged again at the airport. Can she get a refund or a voucher for a bag in another flight?
@united Arranged shuttles, sunset tour, dinner reservations.. *poof* Gone.
An unruly little girl (8yo?) swings her puffy jacket at a @united flight attendant who is in the process of kicking the girl’s mother off the plane for being disorderly. The attendant turns to the girl and says: ‘I WILL SMACK YOU.’ I was completely shocked. Thoughts?
@united The best seat is on any other airline than United
@united 3 all the way !!!!!!
@united Always 1 when flying economy. 3 when flying biz. But, oh how I miss seat 16K on the #747.
@united I love each one of your 30” seats....soooooooo comfy!!!!
I’m about to take my 6th flight on @united in last 9 days. All left on time and all landed on time or well ahead of schedule. Great customer service and seamless gate updates/boarding info to my phone. Super impressive 👏🏼
@united Annd just told we were taken out of line and no planes are departing on our direction, and we're caught in it because of the delay! This is going to be well over 4 hours at best, assuming we can ever leave. I'm not usually annoying but at this point there's compensation, right??
@united haha just don't start charging extra for it
@united 1!!!! Always an isle guy here!
@united where can I find a checked bag receipt online for a past flight?
@united Seat #1 as much as possible
@united 1 for most trips, but 3 if we’re going to be flying over some cool terrain to look out at.
@united my flight to Chicago was delayed 2 and a half hours and my flight back home is delayed an hour and a half, what is this nonsense?
@united Always 1. What’s 4 like?
@united 1! Aisle is best for getting up during the flight and not having to disturb others, and for deplaning at end of the flight.
@united your flight to SFO from AUS is delayed because someone locked the cockpit? Seriously? If I was late you would leave without me. But it’s fine for something so stupid to hold us up and cost everyone time and money (driver will cost more now for waiting time) thanks
We have lost 1,000 dollars due to @united and their 2 hr flight delay because of the broken BEVERAGE CART causing us to miss our flight. Only given 75 dollars off our hotel rooms and 10 dollar vouchers for each person. Outrageous
@united Why even put 2 on there?
@united 3 is my favorite or 1 but the middle seat is the worst.
@united 3 because I love looking out the window but 1 when I’m sitting next to people I don’t know and I usually always have to pee
@united There shouldnt be seat 2! Just Not fair. 👉Get rid of seat 2...widen seats 1 &amp; 3! There! Passengers happy!
@united 3 with a checked bag.
@united None, you made all my miles virtually useless to Japan. So I have moved on.
@united 1. Easy in/out. Can walk aisles without bothering anyone. 🎈
Thank you to the @united employees who resolved my bag fees at the gate. I'm glad to be a member.
@united Short flights #3, long flights I prefer #1
@united UA 1428 unfortunately. Mechanical issue on the plane we were suppose to take apparently. I'd rather be on a flight that passes checks, we agree there, but ugh.. burning a day of vacation on this. I know you don't work on planes, but venting helps. Thanks.
@united I feel like we’re doing your pricing research and those who like seat one are about to get stuck with a higher ticket!
@united It’s depends on who’s sitting next to you 😂
@united On the 2 occasions I was saddled with the middle seat because I booked late, once sandwiched between two 350 pounders and the other time was women who were friends and literally never shut the hell up for 4.5 hours. Animals would have been a welcome exchange in both cases
@united Always 3 so you have somewhere to lean your head and nap undisturbed
@united 3! The window is the best for all the views
@united One of my best flights was #2, I had just gotten an ipad and the two men on either side spent the whole flight teaching me how to use it. #fastfriends.
@united The one in which I don’t find scorpions in the above baggage storage or the seat that I don’t get knocked out and drug off the plane for not wanting to be moved from my previously purchased seat. So I guess the best seat is on a Southwest Fight.....
@united 1 is the worst because I am always hit on the shoulder with the cart etc. Give me 3 for a long flight.
@united I will Choose the seat 1. It is comfortable for. Getting food and beverages!!!
@united 3 all the way! Takeoff, scenery and landing views are great!
@united 1 because I am claustrophobic so it gives the illusion that I am free to leave any time I want. 😉
@united 3 a seat with a view
@united always 3, but with a view of the beautiful wing flex of a 787 and the large windows!
@united 3 for short flights but 1 for overseas flights!
@united Keeps getting better.. 8:40AM flight just bumped back *again* because the line to take off is too long. Any chance I can get back the credits I burnt on this that I earned after the last huge delay, which was my last flight?
@united please help to track down a lost bag!! it never made it onto flight no. UA856 from EWR to IAD, despite being a priority bag &amp; there being a flight delay. can’t get anyone on the phone who knows anything and there are a lot of things in that bag that i need.
@united Short flight: 3. Traveling with family: 2. Flight longer than 3 hours: 1...middle seat ALWAYS should have arm rests...it’s the #middleseat!
@united 3! How many times can you view the world from 37k feet?
@united Then BTR to visit mom 🙃 I’ll grab a King Cake and Beignets for the trip back to IAD 😁
@united 3. A nice view of the friendly skies.
@united Short haul 3, anything over 2.5 hours 1
@united Any seat on UA 1122, but if you’re truly asking 2D.
@united Its not 2 we know that much
@united Window Seat with an amazing wing view!
@united 3 for first time flyers and 1 for regular flyers
@united None of those. Aisle seat in first class is the best.
@united None of the above! Where’s your flatbeds 🤷‍♂️
@united In a few weeks. Flying back to MSY for a few days 🛫💺✈️🛬
@united 1 on long-haul flights; 3 on short-haul flights; 2 when traveling with friends. :)
@united 1 towards the front when I have a short connection time in places like Denver; 3 for most all solo travel since I rarely if ever get up; 2 when I am flying with the hubs who is in 1.
@united It depends, if I'm flying alone then 3, but if I'm with my wife and daughter then 2, so they can look out the window. I don't like 1 because carts tend to hit my elbows, but it is the most convenient seat to use the restroom though.
@united Was U3660. Just forced to change it since the delay makes me miss my connection. Now getting in with just an hour or two left at my friends engagement party 🎉
@united With kids; 2&amp;3 With spouse; 1&amp;3 LOL JK Alone; long flight.. 3 (headrest) short flight ...1
@united 1 in long flights but 3, if it’s short😄
@united First Class Window Seat! 😀 3 for short flights, 1 for long flights. Got to move around on long flights 😄
@united y'all go last minute flight deals!???
Hi @united...for your new premier qualifying points what happens to the $$ you spent at end of 2019 for flights taken in 2020? Did that count in either year? Will I still get PQP when I take the flight? Really tough for those doing only one or two very long trips per year
@united Depending if I have a connecting flight with a short layover, I’ll take 1
@united 2 between my hubby and daughter 🤟🏾I know Im the only one to choose 2!
My first United Airlines @united experience from Newark to Tel Aviv ended up with 5 hours delay and a late Friday night arrival (9:20 pm) due to officially called mechanical issues… Limited transportation available to Rehovot because of the delay and start of Sabbath.
@united The one in premium economy
@united 1, raising the arm rest on the aisle is like sitting 1st class baby!
@united Just based on the fact that they're in the middle and each person in seat 1 &amp; 3 gets one armrest already, I'd say yes....🤔
@united Gotta say -getting on your plane is the beginning of a lifetime adventure whether leisure or work. All good
@united #1 would be the jumpseat (cockpit) for sure!
@united 1, so I can get up when needed (and the fasten seatbelts sign is off) without bothering people
@united 1 is the best seat
@united First of all there is too much leg room in this pic😱😱🤮
@united 2a or 2f on the B737
@united Definitely 1.....need the extra leg room
@united 3. always 3. sleep is essential 😴
@united Always #1.. most head and shoulder room. Being able to get up an stretch more easily on longer flights is a huge plus. Another plus is being able to reach across the isle when traveling with my family!
@united 1 for long flights to Hawaii and 3 for short or long continental flights for mountain river farm views 😎. Greenland was amazing btw
@united Direct aisle access, lie-flat business class.
@united UA3660. Updated time was 11:30 am, but obviously that’s not happening as it’s 11:32 am and no news.
@united I want you guys to study the shape of a human spine, and measure the average length of the human male femur.
@united 1 all day. I'd have reservations about anybody that picks 2 willingly🤨🤔
@united 1 always but my favorite is 1 D in Polaris
@united 3, the best inflight entertainment is out the window
@united They are all tough if you are over 5’6”
@united It could be any of the 3 if you allowed for enough space.
@united 1!🙌 Unless I'm traveling to Hawaii, and then I like a window seat so I can see the ocean and beach!
@united Short domestic flight 3️⃣ International flight 1️⃣ ✈️ 🌎
@united Every time I fly out of Cleveland there seems to be an issue. Today the lav on my plane is broken, but you had to wait for the next crew before servicing it (even though plane arrived an hour ago?) and now my flight is delayed with no end in sight? Do better.
@united None of the above. The best seats are when there are only 2 on a side, not 3. In that case, either 1 or 2 are good. Whose idea was putting three seats together anyhow?
@united Definitely 3 or 2 when you are traveling with two other known people so you can rest on either side
@united 1 only, unless it’s a Dreamliner then 3
@united 3. The view out the window plus the Airshow on the screen=Powerful combination for a flight.
@united 1. I only like aisle seats, quick access to the lavatory without disturbing others
@united Trick question,none of the above. Those are some shitty uncomfortable looking seats
@united As long as I don't have to feel like a cosmonaut crammed into a Soyuz capsule, we're good. Narrower is really not better. Closer is not better. Cramming is not better. I'm tired of feeling tired when my travel day is done. Number 3, btw...
@united Always 1, as I can get up when I want. NEVER 2!!!
@united I used to be a 3 but as I got older, 1 is way better.
@united make sure y’all don’t have racist flight attendants!! SMH
@united Getting out 1. Going back home 3. Never 2 😅
@united 3, good for view and sleep on red eye flights. Best would be Polaris though 😅
@united For my legs better 1 ✈️ but It depends on the duration of the trip
@united I was thinking to the lavatory 🚽😂
@united Long haul flight #3, under 5 hrs. #1 and no option #2, closing in 1 million united miler soon with 1 1/2 long haul flight.
@united Are you a real person or am I just speaking to a robot
@united Depends on how tired I am (Window) , how long the flight is and how my back is feeling (isle).... as well as if my son is traveling with me (then I’ll sit in the middle so he can have the window) Haha
@united That was "Buddy!" He's no longer with us but he was great at hearing noises 15 floors down and alerting us that holiday!
@united 3 is my favorite seat, hands down!
@united The one that isn't on a United plane.
@united - sadly have to leave Mexico for the colder climate of home tomorrow and notice my reservation only includes 2 passengers in my group of 5 ..some of who are kids. As much as I'd like to stay how do I resolve this please
@united NONE. Only "good" seat for me is first class, because coach is too small. Americans keep getting bigger, but plane seats keep getting smaller. One could call it discrimination. At the least, it's one more thing that makes for unhappy customers.
@united 3. Who is picking 2?
@united 3 of course! I love looking out over the mountains and the beautiful sky and reflecting on life.
@united In order. 1, 3, I’ll wait for the next flight.
@united 1. I'm over 6'1" and need to get up frequently to stretch (better to do that without climbing over people)
@united #teamwindow unless it’s a long haul
@united do you mind following me too? ^^ I am trying to hit 50 followers
@united NONE! These seats are the most uncomfortable.
@united 1 but 20 rows forward. 1A?
@united None of them! All of them are too small for one to have a decent trip. Hope you all make enough money.
@united Make us stay at Washington overnight and only gives us 10$ vouchers for lunch and dinner. Thanks for paying for my drink I guess.
@united 3 for long flights, 1 for shorter ones!
@united I'm an isle guy. Easier access to the facilities, and faster exit time. However, you may have to get up on more than on occasion to let people by.
@united Why, so that you can charge more for it?
@united the flight was booked to leave tomorrow and they are saying the only thing they can do is rebook them for a flight on Wednesday...3 days later and would not cover anything. Absolutely insanity. DO NOT EVER USE THIS AIRLINE.
@united Any seat not on United.
@united Do three rows of two eliminate middle seats
@united short trip 1, long trip 1 or 3, 2 may as well not exist
@united 3 always great looking at the majestic engines and the wings. My future career is planned to be a pilot for Widerøe, Norways regional airline. I am Norwegian so ^^
@united For a long flight 1. A short one 3.
@united None. There’s no legroom for passengers.
@united 3 for me all the way. BTW why haven't I seen an update to my premier status for 2020?
@united absolute joke of an airlines. My mom, sisters, their kids, my special needs auntie have been randomly pushed off their flight to Canada from Puerto Rico for zero reason. The flight is not cancelled as my other Auntie is still booked to take the same flight...
@united 3. Shade down with a nap. Never 2 unless with all family. Never 1 because I forget to tuck my elbows in and get bumped by every passerby.
@united Hmmm.... I wanna say 3 (because I do love the window). But.... I don’t want all the windows to suddenly become “preferred” seating in which there’d be a premium charged to select it. Therefore, I will go with 2 😁
@united The one on an Amtrak superliners
@united I think 1 is the best because I can go to the toilet whenever I want！
@united None of the above because they’re all too small
@united 3 always it’s great to see the skies
@united 1. So you don't have to sit on another's lap x 2 when having to get up to use the bathroom. Plus when 2 and 3 have to get up you can easily step out in the isle... Better for your circulation as well
@united Things I don't want to do is give United more info so that they can price structure me out of a seat I want. So here-- my favorite is 2. Also, I really crave fewer inches in width and pitch. I also do not like complimentary snacks and beverages.
@united #1! You can run to the 🚽, anytime! 😅 #beingunited
@united The ones with more leg room than that! #tallpeopleproblems #kneestochest
@united The best seat, would be a seat on another airline…
@united For first time destinations, 3. For any other destinations, 1.👌🏿
@united 1. I pee a lot.
@united Big milestone this morning, over 24 hours of flight delays inside of 6 months! Very impressive 👏👏 Time to reconsider my status. #Delta?
@united Always 1, always exit row.
@united Anyone who replies 2 should not be allowed on a flight. 1 and 3 are equal depending on how long the flight. You wont see a first class seat unless you are Global Services or buy it with your changes
@united 3... unless you’ve been hitting the bar pre-flight
@united Seat #1! Compact people like me love the challenge of fitting in. Seat #2 was good in my earlier, sub-compact, traveling days. Because many of my routes are routinely repetitive, Seat #3 is meaningless!
@united The one that’s on time and on schedule is the best seat
@united Book me both ..I'll come up with the best😉
@united All three at the same time
@united None of them because they’re not on my G5.
@united You make this very difficult, because of the multiple seating types implemented. The issue is foot space. Video/TV boxes at your feet limit space under seat by nearly 33% if you get the wrong seat. Forces you to keep legs tight together. This quite uncomfortable for long flight.
@united Seat 1. I prefer a seat at the aisle.
@united I like 3, wife #1
@united I spent 20 years as a window guy, but one day after a hot EWR-ORD leg I made the decision to become an aisle-guy. Now, it's aisle seats, right side of the plane as you face forward.
@united I prefer to be dragged down the aisle
@united Or the contrary, I think.
@united Seat 1. Freedom to move about the cabin. :)
@united IF most travelers knew etiquette then I would pick #2 since the middle seat supposedly gets both armrests; however, not many people know this and this I select #1.
@united Just leaving on connecting flight will send PM later today after arrival.
@united I would like 3 but i always get 1
@united 3 for airlines l usually use the restroom before boarding so l don't bother others and l take window so l don't have to do the up down shuffle. On subway either #4 or 1 because people sit on four tend to put their feet on 3, 1 just because l am by the doors
@united For the sleepers No. 1. For the tinklers No. 3.
@united 2 - but only in the last row.
@united Which ever seat can actually get somewhere on time. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@united Best seat is not pictured.....
@united 1! 1! 1! 1! 1!
@united 1 for short flight, 3 for a long flight
@united On United Airlines planes, there are NO good economy seats if one is taller than 5’10”.
@united The one with even a small amount of legroom.
@united Definitely 3, I like having a place to lean without getting knocked by a cart or another person. But 2? Not even seats 1 and 3 want someone in 2.
@united lost my bag, was supposed to be delivered yesterday but wasn’t. Now waiting again, your baggage resolution center is not helpful. Where is my bag?
@united I ain’t telling y’all shit! Y’all just want to use that information to see where you can raise prices
@united I usually choose 1, but I often find that I have to squish my bag under the seat...
@united The empty one (hopefully) next to mine
@united Wow wish you left from my airport
@united 1 but in Polaris business class!
@united 1 for daytime; 3 for nighttime; never ever (ever) 2.
@united 3 for me I do not like middle seat
@united Number 1 so I can piss as much as I want
@united Long haul - 1 Short haul - 3
@united 1 for under three hours; 3 for over three hours (sleep) and 2 only if my queen and princess are in 1 and 3.
@united Any seat that doesn't include beeing on a United-flight... 🤔😖
@united I choose 1️⃣... I’m an aisle guy.
@united Aisle or I don’t fly
@united The third seat. Then you get to see your destination from the air.
@united None, adult humans have their knees hit the seat in front of them no matter which one they’re in.
@united 3, and if you sit window on a flight shorter than 4 hours, don’t get up
@united 3 for my kid to look out the window, aisle for my husband to get up and pee easily, middle for me to hand out chargers and such as needed
@united 3 but with leg room
@united IDY, i never get to travel, but if you'd like you give me and my wife a ticket to St. Maarten i'd be more than happy to let you know ! yea right, in my wildest of dream !
@united I'm a window guy. If it's a short flight I don't need to get up anyway and if it's a long flight I want to use the window for sleep. Add to that I don't have people annoying me to get up.
@united 3 for long flights (sleep against the window) 1 for short flights. Never 2, never ever 2
Ugh ☹️ @united terrible - as in substantially lacking - wheelchair assistance in Denver for my 91 year old mom. Very frustrating.
@united If I can’t afford First, I don’t go.
@united Lol show a 3 where the window isn’t lined up
@united Leave in 24 hours. Excited to bring back these sweet babies 🐶 but 7800 for first class upgrade is 😵
@united Thankfully, united personnel in Buenos Aires solved the situation and we were able to sit together on this trip.
@united ..Do u have any programs for travelers who will be flying 16 hours for a animal rescue mission then another 16 hours to get home. But let me know! I saw there were openings when I went to check in &amp; was wondering if I provide docs showing rescue work it would be cheaper
@united So this is what u do when I’m asleep
@united I strongly dislike this airline
@united Good grief, the poor kid
I just ran Amazing Race style through IAH to catch my international flight because my @united flight from DTW was delayed. ZERO assistance was offered to help expedite me getting from gate B79 to E3, which involved riding the skyway.
@united Oh. Guess I should have thought of that.
@united We already have sent our confirmation details and did no help and has cost us a lot of money
@united Not sure who makes the rules at United airlines in Rochester New York but something's got to change. Me and numerous others missed our connected flight because of something wrong with the beverage cart on the plane. Just a joke
@united my kids uber dropped him at the international terminal for his 10:55 flight. He's never flown out of Atlanta. I don't think he'll make it.
.@united any status update on flight 2138, since our pilot refuses to speak? Been sitting here for 30+ mins.
@united this is just complete bull shit
I’m scheduled to go to Hong Kong in 3 weeks. Due to the civil unrest, this trip should be rescheduled to a more peaceful time. I called @united and they confirmed they will be charging $300 to cancel, even though there’s a safety issue due to no fault of my own!!! Ridiculous!!
@united Maybe. Got put on standby for the same flight that was taken away from us
So, @united in 2020 is off to a bad start, 1st trip of the year and we’ve had a glitchy system, policies that don’t match the website and customer service agents who’ve lied to our faces three times. So glad I have status with them. Time to switch airlines? #united #elitestatus
Thank you for the upgrades @united Looking forward to 3630 and 1131! Best airline in the galaxy!
@united has the worst service out of any airline I have flown.
@united I am a frequent flyer with your airline (for now), this The the first time something like this ever happened. This is a 12 hours flight, does this make any sense to you?!
Amazing @united flight Heathrow to Newark for Christmas in NYC. Best transatlantic flight I’ve had by a mile. Great service, comfort and overall experience. Will be flying with you again!
@united thanks for losing my bag!!!
@united missed flight because customs and border patrol for miss flagging. I call and ask to get next available flight and we made the change for $75 I get a call 30 minutes later saying that flight is too expensive and they can't honor what they first offered. Ridiculous
@united I have a delayed baggage still stuck in SFO. I have been waiting for 2 days now to be transferred to Air Canada and be sent to YVR. That’s a big trouble for me, because I had to buy things I needed that were in my luggage. Is there any way to speed up the process?
@united who lost his mind in accounting?! I asked for a sandwich on a flight (the mid flight “snack”. The answer was: “no, you have to wait for a few hours, these are rationed and we do not trust the passengers to tell us if they already got one before”.
@united trying to find where in your policy it states a missed connection can result in a cancelled return trip. Thanks
They expected us including two kids 7&amp;9 to sleep at the Airport IAD. @united
Reminder to @united flyers with gold or higher status: The app’s list of flights open to a free same-day change from your booked itinerary isn’t the final word. If a booking search shows other routings with seats open, call in and ask for those flight numbers.💺
Stay tuned, I will report shortly how @united is treating families in the middle of the night because of airline caused delays!
@united Just got word that we are boarding again.
4 out of 5 doctors recommend @united
@united Again probably the worst customer service ever. Never fly United
@united Ok is there any other flights you can get us on
@united Well that’s great. Is not like I had planned for an early arrival, 5am, for no reason, it should be ok for me and my wife to waste pretty much a whole day of our vacation waiting for the box! Can’t make it home to my parents yet. Thanks 😏
Genuinely rattled. It seems like every time I ever fly @united, some shit happens and my flight plans get messed up on one leg of the flight.
@united Twitter team the best in the biz. No question. No need to ever pick up the phone anymore!
@united hello, having some major issues with flight plans since my flight got delayed. Could use any help I can get.
@united File Reference: SJU28852M Dungeness Crabs x 8, at $30-$40 a piece 😭
@united Flight 5745, delayed no water coming in and the maintaintsnce crew is thumbing through a manual trying to find what the issue is. They seem to be clueless.
Family or friends in months, has had no school and communication with friends or family. Pls Twitter help #BringOscarHome pls contact @united to block the non revenue flights so they can’t keep running and let the authorities catch them.
Al desembarcar del vuelo 1065, se me cayó el celular en el avión. Sucedió algo poco común en la CDMX, el personal de @united esperó a que me comunicara y lo devolvió. Felicidades por su honradez y mil gracias.
@united It’s not just the appearance. Having food and crumbs on thefloor is dirty and frankly unsafe. The armrest is coming apart and has sharp edges. There’s no power anywhere . I can’t wait to get up in the air and see how well the WiFi works! You can (and must) do much better
in 2016 @united lost all four of my bags LOL and the claim just came thru and they issued me $500 that can only be redeemed to buy an airline ticket get absolutely FUCKED cunts
@united Ok please reply as soon as you can . Thanks
@united also! i just checked the carry-on baggage policy again and it doesn't seem to mention anything about weight limits. do you have a weight limit?
@united why can't you get my precheck # in your system properly? Three strikes in a row . . . why should i fly you again?
@united could you please put my luggage cover back on next time. I purchased a cover for protection now my samsonite luggage is a mess. Avoidable if yall would have taken the time you took to go through my luggage to put my cover back on. My luggage didn't make the flight anyway.
@united thank you very much for the quick response!!
Thank you!!! @united for the bump to #business on our flight to Panama 🇵🇦
@united not meaning to sound dumb but just wanting to make sure, your carry-on luggage dimensions of 9x14x22 includes wheels&amp;handles but does this include the telescopic handle in extended state? no right? bc it would be stored on the plane in nonextended state, it wouldnt matter
So frustrated!my bag has been sitting at SFO for over 5 days+ because someone is too lazy to get it on a flight to me. Did not imagine not having my bag during my HONEYMOON and sitting on daily calls to united baggage support (who provides no proactive updates)@united
Frustrating that @united flight leaves with empty seats in first cabin and they can’t clear you when you’re the only one on the list. Direct flight that is not direct. You’re system is so wrong.
For 17 weeks I have dedicated my time, energy and money to attending all 16 Buffalo Bills game this season. That streak stops today, with a playoff game on our doorstep. Thanks @united
@united looks like I might miss a flight (UA934) after my previous United flight (UA1559) was delayed. Will this flight be held to allow people connecting to board? If not what are my options?
@united Yes, there are 10 of us are you able to hold the flight?
@united All my options put me in later than the delayed flight
@united Yes, there are 10 of us are you able to hold the flight?
Is 84MB for the @united App really necessary?
@united We are suppose to go to Turks and Caicos from D.C and that flight leaves at 7:30-8:00
@united trying to leave from Rochester to go to Washington D.C to go on vacation and we have not departed due to a beverage cart being loose. This is the worst flight I have been on and I don't believe it. This is horrible and I am never flying United again. Terrible service.
@united why didn’t y’all let me on the flight wtf😡😡😡😡. never flying with y’all again
@united Thank you! Crisis averted. Got a seat and boarded. Let’s hope my luggage is on the same plane. lol Now I can relax til I get to LA. 👍
Things were going pretty good, arrived at Puerto Rico to find out @united did not or failed to load my box/checked bag of frozen crabs.....ohh and now to top it off, they already said they are not responsible for perishable food items. WTF 🤬
The utter ongoing incompetence of dtw @united is shocking!
hi @united idk who I talked to on the phone but they deserve a pay raise for not only being kind and courteous but getting us to New Orleans earlier!
@united another delayed departure out of DTW due to your shitty ground crew. Last 5 flights.
So, long story short, I’m back to disliking @united.
Truth to be told. I’ve never been a fan of @united, but i said “Maybe I’m judging them too harsh”. The seats were a bit uncomfortable, but i said “hey, every airlines has at least one or two planes that aren’t that fancy or confortable, besides I’m on economic class”
@united straight up bullied me and my wife traveling with an #ESA. Absolutely hostile to passengers who need accommodations.
@united my flight from ORD to MSP was delayed 4 hours. Should I still go to the airport for my original take off time?
Ja. Lo que faltaba. @united dejó mis maletas en Houston. 😡
@united This is a 24 hour delay. I need compensation!
@united I thought you wanted to see the face of one of the reasons people will stop flying United. Safe travels!
@united Dream of your Unique control tower with icon4us .com Best wishes for 2020. Marco
About to fly with @united Please try to don't lose my luggage... again!
@united Given the amount of money I paid for the end of my vacation to be ruined, there won’t be a next time.
@united Thanks, I hope that means it a actually will work.
@united Hi, does that mean the WiFi is actually working? I know it’s all technically availability but does not work with alarming frequency and if it doesn’t I’d consider changing flights.
FINALLY back in Houston. I was supposed get back Friday evening at 5:20 pm. But thanks to @united and their piss poor planes and service, it’s now Saturday morning 1:45 am. And I still have a 45 minute drive home. 😊
@united I would like my journey to be refunded with damages. Don't want to risk my luggage again with you folks. Not to mention I will urge everyone not to fly united again.
@united This is super frustrating and just like the phone service you guys are giving us the runaround.
Hey @united will the WiFi work in flight 181 today? Thx
@united worst customer service - ever!
@united An empty seat should be up for grabs for passengers in the flight and I successfully have and always will try to occupy a more comfortable empty seat.
@united ... unless United has some cool new technology for new passengers to board mid-air. Please send your employees to basic logic school before unleashing them on twitter. You are embarrassing yourself in addition to being inconsiderate to your customers.
@united That is the worst analogy ever. A currently empty Lexus is not going to be empty forever - it can and will be sold at a later date. A seat on a flight that has taken off is not up for sale for the duration of the flight ...
@united I'm extremely unhappy with United providing free flights to illegal immigrants. I'm a loyal United customer, almost 1 million miles, been Global Services, currently 1K. I'm all for legal immigration. I'm absolutely opposed to illegal immigration. Will not support it, or United.
@united United flight 766 SFO-PDX. Delayed then cancelled due to mechanical issues. Allegedly we now depart at 12:15am (8:17 originally). Thanks United. You say you value our time. Show me how you do. Did I mention traveling with a 6 y/o and senior citizen??
@united Not sure how many times I have to say this but they found it. Your agents had it in their hands. Now it’s gone. This needs to be fixed. This is unacceptable.
@united No! The representatives say they are still looking. The problem is that we were told at the gate that they had it. Every time we talk to someone, they tell us that they call over t Dulles but no one is picking up and they can’t give us the number. It’s frustrating!
@united I have had 2 bags sitting in Phoenix for 7 days. Have made multiple requests to have them delivered to Flagstaff. How do I find out what is happening? Calling everyday-no updates, no notes, no help
@united ...and told her we would take her to her connecting flight, while my wife made contact with her daughter. We managed to get her to baggage claim where her daughter came running to calm her down and we gave her a warm hand-off...
@united ...we used her note to call the number listed, which belonged to her daughter who was waiting for her outside baggage claim. The elderly woman broke down in tears at this point because she didn’t know who we were, adamant she should be in California. We put her in a wheelchair...
@united Flew international with United for the first time and was very pleased!Traveling with a toddler and an infant during an 8 hour layover in Denver was made much more pleasant. Overall, great service before, during and after flights! Thanks United #AmericanAirlinesDoesntCompare
@united ...we asked her in Spanish what gate she was looking for and found out (via the note) she had Alzheimer’s, needed a wheelchair, had been left w/out assistance. This, while 2 other people were being assisted off the plane in wheelchairs—the assistants ignored our pleas for help...
@united no because there was no one available to help since it was 12:30 at night. our luggage finally came after the unexplained delay. there was just an unreasonable lack of communication between united and everyone waiting for their bags and no one seemed to care or want to help
@united ...she was asking about a connecting flight to Cali. She didn’t have a flight. She had a note detailing her condition &amp; instructions for assistance. But the handler simply let her go. We found her wandering the arrival gate looking terrified after we exited the restrooms...
@united Passenger said her name was Gloria. We 1st saw her asking the stewardess for info, who pawned her off to a baggage handler on the jetway because she didn’t speak English...
What a day. After a mission trip to the DR we flew @united &amp; the tickets we BOUGHT were never paid for by the travel agent or UN made an error &amp; we had to pay twice the original cost THEN after traveling from 12 PM to 11:45 PM we waited for our luggage until now. 1 am!
@united It was found! Now it’s missing. The gate agent said they had it. We just want our Kindle back or for the airline to replace it.
@united no they said “it’s ‘arrived’ so nothing we can do”
@united (3) there was no explanation nor reassurance from anyone on where our luggage was and we suffered extreme emotional distress through this process! also i overheard that someone’s dog was missing from the flight? anyways, that’s why i stress cried
@united (2) a police report with the nonexistent airport help desk. after every other flight was unloaded, our luggage came out 2 hours later
@united monday, our out bound flight was delayed twice for almost 4 hours, which we understood. tonight, however we arrived to RDU &amp; it said our baggage was arrived but after waiting an hour and a half, all the bags were missing. and when we went to the info desk the guy told me to file
@united I was traveling today. from Newark NJ to RDU
@united Ok, just filled out the form. Also, realized I said it was a flight from Dallas, but it was actually from Houston. Thanks
hello @united you contributed to my first tears of 2020. couldn’t let me go a week into the year huh
@united I'm looking to upgrade my seats for an upcoming flight, however I'm not sure which seats are actually an upgrade and matches the cost I see? Also can this upgrade be purchased with points? Should I call customer service?
@united We were at Dulles DC. We left an item and Discover that we are missing it when we moved terminals to our layover flight. At the point were we laying over they called over to the other gate we arrived at and they said they found the item. It’s now missing.
@united They had it at the gate, now it missing.
@united Yes, it was UA Flight 7, landed Friday at Narita. I hope mine was a one-off and no one else got sick. 😟
@united Thanks for the response, but it still doesn’t fix the issue. She paid for a service which United is not providing. Customer service means taking care of your customers. Otherwise you lose them. Plain and simple.
@united just got married...heading out on flight UA726 with my husband...please upgrade us #justmarried #weswipedright #lovelove
Got the worst food poisoning of my life from an omelette on @united flight from Dallas to Tokyo. So thankful my husband and daughter opted for the pancakes.
@united I heard you had a big meeting. If you want to talk, send me a request to talk here, but I want to talk to the person in your company that has no supervisor. I'll hang up in a second if you're not that person. Send me your number. No threats just offering. I'm a good guy.
@united She did and was told that her flight is tomorrow at 4:50. Her name is Maria Adonay. Page her at Dulles and make it right.
@united yeah but now my trip with two flights has turned into a trip with four flights.
@united Okay so if she pays for it now, she will definitely be refunded later with proof of documentation?
@united Really? YOUR flight was delayed, causing my daughter to miss her connection and she can’t get a hotel voucher even though passengers were told they would get one? 16 hours overnight in Dulles until the next flight? Poor service. I am ashamed of you.
@united nah bitch I'm going to delta
Thank you @united for being my first flight since moving to New York that has taken off on time and landed on time 🙌🏼
@united She cannot contact you directly. Could I call you if I have all of the information needed? Or her mother?
@united Thanks for the update but that doesn’t change the fact that now I am going to be 3 hours late and will no longer be able to take a train into the city. An Uber is going to be $70-$100. What can be done on the fare of my flight or a voucher for future flights?
@united Why am I sitting on your plane, UA6348, in the middle of the airport for 20 minutes after landing in Norfolk?
@united My first of many “meals” on UA tin this year. #1k
so @united canceled my flight gives me two $10 meal vouchers for the hotel or the airport. wtf am i gonna buy with $20???
@united I have never experienced worse customer service not only at an airport but any place of service jesus christ....
@united I’m going to need you to assist me ASAP. My best friend is in New Zealand. She purchased flight insurance. Her father has passed away, yet your airline is trying to charge her just for an earlier flight?? Please fix this. Her family and friends want her home.
This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced! @united
Had the worst experience with @united at multiple points today. They are inconsiderate of customers’ time and money - delayed our bags from an on time flight and tried to make us pay for more checked bags #neverflyingunitedagain
@united The workers here confirmed it’s on the flight that lands next. So thanks but that doesn’t help. Just sitting in baggage claim making our travel time almost 27 hours till we get home. Exactly how we envisioned finishing our honeymoon 🤦‍♂️
@united WORST airline ever! Your staff is fully willing to put two contagious people on four flights- trying to charge them $1000 to follow doctors orders to not get on a plane
@united Thanks for the reply but that doesnt really help. Not exactly ideal to sit in another airport after arriving home 24+ hrs of travel, &amp; on our honeymoon no less. The fact that its just brushed off further exacerbates simply not wanting to give u another chance #UnitedHorrorStories
After a full day of mechanical and maintenance issues that caused hours upon hours of delays, @united tops it all off by losing my bag. 😠😡😤
@united Hey great news, thank you and happy new year !
@united 50 mins AND flight 2062 won't take off. #UnitedAirlinesSuck
@united I have l, but my bags had 50 minutes to get to the plane so I’m UPSET.
@united on the 27th, 7 hour delay from SFO to EWR, on the way back (on the 3rd) 3 hours delay
@united Even more: flight 2062 i already 35 minutes delayed because of your baggage mess, but I guess another "we apologize for the delay" applies, right?
@united I checked for my flight from Cleveland to LAX and got my boarding pass. However I wasn’t issued a seat. Was told I had to see an agent. If I’m not on the plane I paid for them there’s gonna be a massive problem as I specifically chose that time &amp; day to go home.😡
@united I love that United monitors Twitter and promptly responds to travelers with issues. You guys rock!
@united keeps losing my bags dude they suck ass as an airline. Today I’ve had two flights late and now my bags missing 🤪 🖕🏻
@united Yes, I needed/need a United priority tag for United premier access reservation. My apologies that I missed information here. I just flew HX776, UA878 and I am connecting to UA349 (all part of a single United reservation bought directly from United).
@united Need help with a flight 1-4. Don’t tell me to call CustService b/cause first agent lied to me;&amp;the second agent put me on Hold for so long I gave up. I thought I’d try United on a regular flight between CDMX&amp;Chicago. I won’t make that mistake again, but now I need help.
@united you might be the actual devil for trying to fine my parents $1000 to change their flight due to being diagnosed with INFLUENZA two hours ago. You’re actually encouraging a mass #contagion on FOUR connections. Smh
Now the system moved me to another flight automatically and then switched it again and then again all within a period of 8 mins. I have never been this agitated by travel in my entire life and I have moved continents forget cities. @united
@united Not even close to the same thing. The plane is going to the destination anyway, changing seats does nothing.
@united Had the worst service ever and terrible customer service! Don’t bother flying with this airline
@united has the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced ...
In all the time I have spent today to go from west coast to east coast which includes about 9.5-10 hours at the airport + the 5+ hours of the ‘scheduled’ flight time, I could have taken a nonstop flight and visited my parents in india. @united
@united Do better. Give updates. Find gates for your planes before they land. What an outrageous lack of competence made worse by equally bad communication. (We are still on the plane and it’s been MORE THAN AN HOUR since we landed, btw)
@united does the economy plus subscription count towards premiere qualifying points?
How many ways @united sucks...let me count the ways! I’m embarrassed to be a 1.5 million miler on the worst airline flying! #unitedairlinessucks #firsttoworst #oscarnerdstogo
@united clearly doesn’t care about infants and service animals! One of the worst experiences of my life throughout including gate and people at check in! Thank you for a shittiest experience ever!
@united So 60 minutes to unload baggage is acceptable for your standards, I see. Thanks for reminding me one of the reasons you are my last choice. .
Been at the airport for 7 hours, 2.5 to go + 5.5 flight time. This is turning out to be the WORST travel story of all time. 2020 isn’t looking great for travel @united
@united Yes thank you after our flight from EWR landed at 7:46p we finally got our bag at 8:50p...
@united is on a roll for fails today. An elderly woman w/ #Alzheimer’s wandered off flight UA6369 w/out the assistance she was due. Lucky we found her with a note on her &amp; helped her get to her family in El Paso—no thanks to the United crew 😒
Hey @united I spent 3 hrs on the phone, 1 hr in line at the check in and 1 hr at the gate trying to solve your own mistakes. As a loyal 1K member at least I expect that you reply my DMs, and that your employees act respectfully - the same way I am with them.😡
@united Thank you! Your SFO staff were all very kind. Just landed at Denver and we certainly look forward to the continued kindness and generosity 😊
@united My flight is delayed, but at least I know why. I can live with that. Than you for a very good app and a very good experience so far on this trip. #1518
Love being asked to send a note online, after booking a new flight home that cost over $550. JUST GREEAT. @united 🙃🙃🙃🙃
Shoutout to @united for cancelling my flight without notice and not giving me a refund! Fabulous service to begin the new year! 🤦🏻‍♀️
@united I have a change fee question. Tix not purchased yet, so I can't just see by trying it out. If I book a RT ticket then need to add an extra leg to 3rd city before returning to origin ...on the same ticket, is that even an option? What are fees like? Domestic. Thx!
@united It's not only me. It's like More than 50 passengers...!
My @united flight is delayed because “the pilot doesn’t know when he’s going to get here”. Never heard that excuse before!
Hey @united I just DM’d you about a flight I’m about to get on. Let Me Know.
@united Finally at gate, but jetway driver is MIA 🤦🏻‍♂️
Genuinely curious as to why and how people who have a Basic Econ ticket are coming into my flight with full on duffel bags and I’ve been told before - with an Economy ticket - I have to check in my rolley carry on if the expander is open. @united
Hey @united thanks for flying to #PQI. We loved the visit with family there and travel from #DEN was a breeze. #holidaytravel
@united have a bone to pick with your service today
Trying to change our flights from Tbilisi &gt; Warsaw &gt; Vienna &gt; Chicago &gt; Kalamazoo to Tbilisi &gt; Warsaw &gt; Newark and onward. Hoping @united is able to help. Please please please. 🤞
I don’t use credit cards @united
@united TAKE ME HOME!!! I have 2 dogs waiting for me!!!
Can I at least get a hotel?!!! @united
I got here on time! @united
I WANT TO GO HOME @united
After a great week in Atlanta, this flight attendant decides to close the gate before time and without calling my name she closes the flight! I was two meters away and when I got to the door the plane is already gone!! 15 minutes before!! Thank you for nothing @united
@united you guys have a lost item. We have called repeatedly with no help what so ever. We filled out a list item report...nothing. We know your people had it. Now it’s missing? This needs to be addressed.
@united No I didn’t I left after I retrieved my bag from baggage claim
You're gonna charge over three hundred dollars for a one way flight and I can't even bring a bag with me? Honestly how dare you @united
Everything about @united was horrible flying from Bush Intercontinental airport!! From the customer service to waiting an hour for my bags.... damaged bag at that!
.@united I don't even get a goddamn carry-on? I thought American's basic economy was bad but holy shit
@united UA846 cancelled, agent puts me on a flight 24 hours later: "nothing else available." Call back &amp; another agent offers AC 93 leaving 2hrs later. Go to board, AC: " you're on standby." Call United: "you're not on standby, you're confirmed." This is how you treat customers?
@united Yea someone dropped a cellphone in a duct and rumor has it it was never found. Wouldve appreciated more communication from the crew here. Hang on gotta go purchase 3 snack boxes for my kids bc they’re starving 🙄🙄🙄🙄
.@united please give Nick - from Flt 1938, 1/3/2020, IAH-PDX - a raise! He was excellent and took amazing care of us on our flight to the #pnw!
Never flying @united airlines ever again!! Worst customer service ever. 0/10 would not recommend AT ALL.
Next Friday I’ll be on @united flight 729 from Chicago O’Hare Airport to BWI. Time to get ready for my 1st vacation of 2 for the winter.
@united upgraded us to first on our flight back home. Gave the seats to my boys who I know will enjoy it very much ❤️
Hey @united how do we get our missing luggage? The automated recording is NOT helpful! It’s been 24 hours.
@united I just want to let you know that your flight attendants on flight UA 1644 thought it was okay to laugh at my grandfather who has Alzheimers. Pick better employees.
@united Thanks. Glad I checked before booking. I’ll be sure to use a different airline.
Hey @united do you offer Bereavement Flights for military spouse's?
@united Why is it $1000 more to take the same flight with one fewer leg?
@united flight 1482 out of STT delayed at gate for 5 hrs. Communication to passengers has been awful! A little transparency please!
@united if flying LHR-LAX in United Polaris but then connecting to Alaska Airlines, do I get Polaris lounge access?
Every flight I ever caught with @united has been canceled or delayed , one ☆🤜🏾
@united However they had no issue asking me to apply for a credit card.
@united Thank you! We’re departing from SFO-DEN then DEN-MOT to go home. We appreciate your generosity ❤️
Yo @united, I paid for better seats on our Sunday flight home from London. I just got an update from y’all saying you’ve changed the aircraft and removed us from the economy plus seats we bought. You’ve issued no refund or attempted to make it right. Fix it.
Just curious about what the point of priority baggage is if it comes out last? @united
@united this is THE WORST airline. So many problems on my trip to Europe. And to end it all, both my suitcases were damaged &amp; I called baggage customer service and he didn’t want to help. One of my bags REEKED of some type of fuel ruining some contents inside. #DontflyUnited
@united For United Explorer credit cardholders, does the cardholder and others on the same reservation get priority boarding as well?
Wish @united would add a route from BUR-LAS. More Raiders fans in L.A. heading to Vegas in the fall. Logic would suggest a financial win, but I’ve been suggesting it since Raiders announced move in 2017 to no avail.
@united you did it again! Split my reservation at check in and now my husband and I are not sitting together. One thing is for sure, you are in the business of making air travel as un pleasant as possible. #unitedAIRLINES
United Airlines on point today.... Credit where it's due. Leaving Denver for London @united
@united Thank you for the reply. We are inside the warm cabin with no AC. The crew is trying to avoid deplaning.
Flying @united is as pleasurable as slamming your hand in a car door 🙂
@united you guys are terrible. Maybe 30% of my flights go smoothly. It's always something. UA2352 delayed due to a seat broken, then delayed because of baggage and the cabin is hot because there is no AC.
@united After fueling up again, we were told someone dropped their phone bewteen the seats and it fell into the fuselage and now maintenance needs to go try and find it, or they will cancel this flight. It’s 7pm and we boarded 3:30. I’m expecting more than lip service this time...
@united I will DM you but this is too unbelievable not to share it with my twitter friends. First, the flight was delayed by an hour. Then we boarded and pushed back from gate, but the engine was smoking, so we turned back. Then we were told the engine is fine but we need more fuel 1/2
@united how do I check if I left a small gift bag on my flight ?
@united what’s up with being delayed bc a pilot forgot to logout of the previous flight and is now en route to another city?
@united Ok but you're gonna cover whatever new flight I have to get now because your delays made me miss it right?
Stupid worthless "customer service" @united United: "cancel the trip and use towards future travel" Me: "Ok awesome.. lets apply that to the new ticket." United: "Ok there is a $200 change fee" Me: "Uhm, its only a $183 credit..I would be paying you $17 to use my credit" #wtf
I would never fly @united again. Been waiting over 6 hours. Employees are no help.
@united Yes I was told that “it’s normal” for this seat. PS. we are grounded due to smoke from the engine.
@united just sitting here on the tarmac for almost 3 hours now in row 28 of your Boeing 737-200 #3129. That’s not even the most concerning part because the floor (at my seat only) is hot enough to melt my shoes. Is torture now part of your basic economy offering?
@united Just missing my connecting flight because you can't find a plane to put people on. Already delayed over an hour
Today's experience has taught me that @united is literally the worst airline I have ever used
@united How does this affect our #ClimateEmergency?
@united My United flight 743 from Tampa to Newark on Dec 30th was diverted, caused me to miss my connection to Berlin, and lost my suitcase! 4 days later, still no suitcase, and no United Representative can help me or tell me when I will get it back. Please do something!
@united They said they are cleaning the plane not weather after being delayed 4 hours
@united They also tried to separate our 14 yr from us at check in
@united please help us. We are flying with you tomorrow and for some reason our seats have been changed? Why?
@united Thank me the runway waiting. Hopefully we do takeoff when they say we are supposed to. Thank you for your response.
@united The lack of communication or general awareness of what your company is doing is pretty crazy.
@united Stranded at #Syracuse #NY airport bc #unitedexpress overbooked our flight to #DC and now has mechanical problems, do we’re missing our connecting flight no #planes are available! We need to get to Miami by tomorrow morning for our cruise!!!
@united By that same logic then, if the person next to me for the flight is hanging halfway into the seat I paid for then i should be refunded half of what I paid since I did not get the full service/usage of my seat
I don’t understand the new @united MileagePlus system.
Moreover, driving a car off a lot diminishes its value. Whereas the value of the seat in the flying metal tube won't be devalued by budget conscious asses sitting in it. Really wish airlines like @united would stop mistreating/misleading consumers.
Come on @united, surely your #CustomerCare team can do better than that. I’m just trying to sit next to the #MRS here! #Anniversary #WinterGetaway
I'm never flying @united again. Ever.
Hey @united when are you gonna stop screwing tf out of people? The plane has been in the sfo airport for 2 days and you’re telling us now to wait 7 hours?
@united You can't just say yes or no? Lol I thought this would be easier.
First flight of the year and we are delayed. 🙄 @united
@united - delaying this UA2239 flight from 1:15pm to 8:30pm after having the plane at SFO since Jan. 1 and waiting until today to do an investigation is quite disappointing. Raise your level.
Lol @united actually charging me a 20 cent fair different on the phone with an agent. It took about 5 minutes....while you paid this poor lady to do this.
@united do your flights have WIFI?
united is actually the shittiest airline in north america why do y’all go to like two cities from yyz 😤 @united
Carolyn at United Express at EWR was phenomenal and a life saver when saying good bye to our military son @united our day was made 😊
@united Hence why I’m confused now I’m getting updates it’s not found yet.
@united Is the team currently trying to find it ? United club rep had said lost and found had it at Dulles but we couldn’t go there and come back to make our connection to Austin.
@united That’s what they just relayed to us, thank you for your efforts. Have a great day!
@united Correct! Gave as many details as I could. Please help.
@united please help ! We forgot our paintings from Marrakesh for our wedding anniversary on FLT 53 on 1/1/2020 from Zurich to DC. It was left in overhead bin. United club rep said she found it but now the online portal says not found. Seat 3A!
@united I did. Their reaction and I quote: “f*ck that, thanks for letting us know” That was about it...
@united Flying UA23 to Dub later on. Looking forward to seeing the pilots there too, From First class? 😂. Please. 😊
@united trying to get thru on the 1k line for the past two days to speak to a representative regarding upcoming flight but busy every time. Any other way for 1k customer to connect?
@united hey I need some help with a flight . I sent a DM
I’d like to thank @united for profiling my family and neglecting to give us access to the VIP club that we purchased and trying to charge us again. I love America 🤕
@united i booked SFO-IAH-SCL outbound mixed cabin award. Can I be waitlisted for the SFO-IAH flight?
@united Hopefully the 1K line is a little more polite than the people who just wanted to leave for lunch at the SFO baggage service desk. If it can be proven your crew destroys a bag, it should be compensated fairly. Not with some cheap plastic “this’ll do” garbage.
@united Then it wasn’t basic economy... it was the one that allows a carry on and personal
1) Dis donc @united vous vendez la veille pour le lendemain des billets sans mentionner que le visa Esta est indispensable même pour une simple escale de 1h aux US. Or l’obtention de ce visa peut prendre plus de 48h.
I have never had a successful flight without issue when flying @united How is it 2020 and we are still having these issues? Do ur employees get bonuses for screwing us over?
@united Thanks, to clarify (bc i forgot the date), the flight departed ORD on Th Jan 2. I was in in 2K. 😀
@united So can you explain this? My bag meets dimensions but you refuse to check?
@united destroyed my $400 LuggageWorks bag and the “best they can do” at SFO is offer travel credit for further use on their airline or a POS plastic “replacement” option. Yikes. Ok. I think they just lost a 1K member. #NotHappy
@united Just let me leave Denver this is ridiculous
Just boarded the team plane and found a pillow and blanket in my seat. “All ready for your nap.” Is what I was told. Thank you for loving me, @united crew. See y’all in New England!!!
At the mercy of @united airlines because apparently the 6 hour delay for my first flight was the appetizer for this plane with broken instruments
@united Thank you for your quick response.
@united Then who does? I tried reaching out to Lufthansa and Air India and they said United is your final carrier so you should talk to them, and you guys direct me to them! This is a never ending loop where is customer gets fucked in the middle!
@united Do you guys and bagging agents have same access to latest info, cause I was informed by them that the bag might have left for Frankfurt on the 2nd
@united Ok, assist me, To whom can I write or call to explained my worst airline experience but is a decision maker? Not some customer service rep. With a generic answer from a script?
@united received an email not about the credit I’ve been waiting to get but about a bag claim that doesn’t even exist. Called, waited 10 mins to connect with someone only to be disconnected 7 mins into the call. Your airline couldn’t be worse
@united Can you please tell me when this scan was made?
Received my 2020 1K mailing from @united - and very impressed - love the charging disk and the new baggage handle plus new metal cards - a very nice step up from previous years.
@united And even after a 17h delay in Texas to miss her Gmother’s death on Hospice and a guarantee for a refund that NEVER happened we stayed LOYAL 1k/platinum flyers 7 years and they move a disabled person back to accommodate an able family with adult children, despicable.
I love that @united always picks the window seat when they automatically update my seat to first class 😄
@united How about a voucher for moving my partner w/ a disability (AFTER already checked in) from bulkhead i paid extra 4 To get to bathroom easier, just so a family with ADULT and capable children to sit together. To LOYAL 1k/platinum 7 years in a row, bad on you United, despicable.
These are the only numbers I have to try contact my son. Please twitter do your thing 00 1 (765) 299-4155 ... 00 1 (765) 793-3817 . help a baby come home. Both sides of the family miss him and have court agreements to see him. #BringOscarHome @united you are aiding in the kidnap
@united Are you able to extend it?
@united hi, my app says I am waitlisted for an upcoming connecting flight. What does this mean? Why am I being charged to check my back twice?
@united Yes, your “set procedure” is to BS one set of humans with a canned security statement to avoid providing a service while providing another set of humans that same service that goes against “security.” You can’t verbal judo yourself out of what this is.
hi @united me and my family are flying with you on the 15th of february and we were wondering when we will be able to choose our seats? Thank you
My @united flight attendant Jasmine is the real MVP. I saw that she popped her head out the door to make sure the crew didn’t miss my bag on the jetway. 😍🙏
@united was offered a voucher for delayed flight that cannot be used. Can you please exchange it for cash or miles?
@united I just had a FA take my bag by saying it was too big. It meets your exact requirements online but they refused to get a tape measure. It’s 22x14x9 which is exactly what you have on your baggage site. Second flight to do this... want my money back.
@united Yes and she was super sweet. But 6hours overnight, no pillow, ( we got a blanket) and no entertainment seems like a harsh route. Plane is filthy, maybe you should offer disinfectant wipes on board so passengers can clean... empower us to keep plane germ free and clean.
@united Winner gets a signed copy of the next book.
Hi Houston friends. Stuck here for the the night. Thanks @united. Need recommendations for airport friendly BBQ. Happy to cab it.
The hearing was in the PBGC building, where my pension, w/ over 100k other @united workers, sits terminated. The roaches expressed “great concern” for dues individual workers paid, but not once did these parasites show up during the 3-plus yr bankruptcy that destroyed careers 2/2
pilot farted and the smell won't go away @united
@united absolute shambles of organising simple connection flights by yourselves. Giving us an hour to get through customs from Sydney, re-check in our bags and get to a different terminal, which means we’ve missed 2 connecting flights. Will never be using you again.
I don’t know what I did to deserve this, but really enjoying getting Premier Access and upgraded First Class seats, @united! Great experience 😄
@united Flt 2274 to IAD. A man at the check in counter (Cesar, I think) and two ladies working the flight at the gate. All 3 subpar.
@united Doubt that. Hopefully someone from Customer Care can figure out how to communicate effectively.
Hey @united. Your staff at RSW is probably the least helpful that I’ve encountered anywhere around the globe. Not friendly, complaining loudly, not helpful when traveling with an infant, over charging for bags when we are MileagePlus Premier, etc. Be better.
@united It was great thanks 🙏
@united Yep, and the now four representatives I’ve spoken with have all given me conflicting information.
Belated, but kudos to @united for my flights last month. Planes feel old, BUT, incredible legroom
I do wonder if I was as incompetent as the ppl on the phone w @united if Id be fired or get to keep my job.
@united I’ve been trying to get my mileage number for an hour, dropped calls and for whatever reason can’t get it via email. Please dm.
Another exciting year @united real estate. Let’s keep it going in 2020. If you are in the market to buy or sell your house, no better agent than I! Over $7 million in property sold in 2019.
@united thank you I'll fill out the form
@united what are the chances of finding my daughter’s AirPods that were left on flight UA 975 landed in IAD yesterday seat 1L #lostandfound 🙏🏻
I’m just trying to understand why @united called me to tell me they had a better resolution to my Christmas Day flight debacle, but never emailed. And when I called back to follow up, they’re acting clueless. New year, same struggling customer service.
@united Mr. Zhang EWR Gate 75 agent, friendly &amp; professional face of United today. Not like EWR Gate 74 Club Lounge clerk who yelled at my husband and my kids and denied us entry. Thank you Mr. Zhang for valueing customer loyalty, you are my hero 🦸🏻‍♂️ #UnitedBeGoodToYourCustomers
@united Yes omg had some yesterday. 🧇
@united if only I could get home from my nice vacation to Disneyland. your customer “service” sucks. fix it.
@united can you see my tweets now
@united can you please look at your DM’s. Thank you!
@united That doesn’t help me at all- the baggage service desk told me to file online which is the link you referred me to just now. And that link asks me to require proof of purchase. Which is a receipt I threw away years ago. Thanks though!
The concept of charging for standby seats, Especially while the plan is loading, floors me. Not only am I not going to pay it, now you don’t free up a seat on the plane that could’ve otherwise used it. @united
@united ive been waiting ALL day, and i can't do shit can i have them already ffs
lmao i want my bags @united
@united The flight attendants said they are too busy. Really disgusting to your first class passengers...
@united 1st aircraft delayed bc the toilet was clogged. Now our flight doesn’t have any running water and the flight attendants won’t serve drinks in first class. Flight #1573 iah to lga. #servicefail
@united currently on flight USL22 connecting to UA2394. Delayed xtra 3 hrs with plane and seat swaps. Downgraded from 787 Polaris lie flat seats to 737 winglets old seats plus 6 hour total layover. 5 in our party. Please fix. Coming from Europe w/ 4 year old and pregnant wife
@united for basic economy from EWR to SFO is a carry on bag allowed and if it costs money how much
@united I paid separately for baggage fees on a refundable ticket . I needed to cancel the ticket . Will the baggage fees automatically get refunded or do I need to apply for a refund?
@united your flight and customer service sucks
So finally got a human on the phone for @united and my bags sitting in a warehouse in Houston even though I put the claim on it on Dec 27th. They went through my bag and listed items inside. And tried to blame me for it not being returned. I’m furious.
@united 6th trip to Maui with you in April. Can't wait! Yes, we've had some frustrating delays, but it happens with every airline. As long as we get there and back safely. See you in April! 😉
@united We have a Connection from New York to Frankfurt, Germany over Philadelphia. New York EWR to Philadelphia ZFV is done by train. Are the E-Tickets enough for going by train or do we need some seperate Ticket/ Check-in ? Thanks!
@united Your really don't understand customer loyalty at all
@united This day with you is getting better and better. First I get booted off the upgrade list with no explanation and now my eight year old is being charged to enter your club. I guess gold and platinum status on your airline doesn’t mean anything in 2020 😡
@united so I have PlusPoints that I have to redeem on flights before the points expire even if I book a future flight
@united has managed to mess up a really good awards program and scew around with earned rewards.
@united demonstrated their true colors today. We asked for H2O for our child [to help equalize his ears] &amp; they said no. Why? Because it’s a “security issue” — while they served food &amp; drinks to 1st Class in her face. I guess money equals “security.”
@united He was excellent! Thank you!!
@united I was supposed to be home at 5:20 pm on a Friday. I won’t get home til Saturday dealing with this terrible excuse for an airline.
@united Please check your DMs. Would love to start 2020 with a great customer service experience with you ✈️
@united you’re a broken record bud
there’s gotta be a better way to do all of this @united maybe there wouldn’t be such long lines checking bags if y’all didn’t make everyone pay for a carry on 🤡
Thank you @united for taking me to and from Cape Town &lt;&gt; DC with ease and safety. Your direct service from CPT -&gt; ERW was fantastic. Here’s to another Platinum year in 2020 and stops in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas!
@united Can someone please help me?
Now that Rhapsody in Blue, by George Gershwin, is in the public domain, I want to see better airlines start using it in their marketing. @united is far too shitty an airline to ne able to own the association with such a masterful piece of work.
@united shouldn't your ground crew also "receive feedback" about loading the meals your in-flight magazine claims are supposed to be available, as well? if space or time were at issue, why wasn't one meat and one meatless option loaded, instead of 2 meat meals?
@united more frustrating was the complete lack of barf bags.
@united the plane, however, was only loaded with hot dogs and hamburgers.
@united no, because the in-flight for-purchase meals are supposed to be hot dog, hamburger, mezze sampler, and cheese platter. the mezze sampler and cheese are meatless, so what is the need to request a vegetarian meal?
@united That isn’t good enough. I will be compensated for the extra money I’m having to pay and for not being home on time due to your mechanical error. Who lets passengers sit on a tarmac for NOW 5 hours? Are you all mad?
Oh and @united your FAT employees that night are 💩 too offered zero help in figuring a way home. Had to call the customer service line and wait on hold for over an hour. To be told I'd get refunded for a rental. Which you are now telling me I won't be getting.
@united Yeah, I paid for your WiFi and it didn’t work the entire flight.... that’s not right. And nothing was done about the screen
Hey @united , can I make a review video of your new SFO-DEL flight?
I now have no clue how I’m getting home, I have to pay more for parking at the airport, and they have the audacity to make me pay for this WiFi to communicate with you all and my family. @united I need a resolution.
I have been sitting on this tarmac for OVER 4 hours and have missed the last leg of my flight home thanks to @united. I left Accra last night and have been stuck in Belgium due to their error and I missed my connecting flight in Newark to Houston.
Had to rent a car with a stranger and drive from FAT to SFO. It was the last car on the lot. Wouldn't have rented the car if @united hadn't said they would pay for it. Your customer service is absolute 💩.
Wow, I usually hate flying @united but this flight was delightful. Thanks y’all! ✌🏾
This flight is exactly why I almost always refuse to fly @united. Even when another company pays my ticket. But this time a family member bought the ticket. 🙄 #ua4662. #messyunited. #shitshowispredictable
@united YALL DIDNT EVEN OFFER US ANY SNACKS! And you’re talking about waiting to assess the situation. I’ll never fly with United again.
Completely horrific conditions and inhumane treatment last night at Newark by @united. Arrived at airport and checked in on time, but was denied boarding. Now you won’t reaccommodate my flights? Disgusting, deplorable treatment.
@united my son turns from 11 years to 12 years old during the trip we’re planning. Do I book child or adult on the flight?
So @united, not only was I not allowed on my flight last night due to something out of my control, you cancelled my return flight home without my authorization, your customer service was horrendous, and you expect me to fly with you again because of a waiver? Great incentive.
@united Because I would also not like to go pass the threshold of your 7 days and then get screwed out of my financial compensation
@united Well what is yalls window before you give up and pay me for my property? I mean I would prefer my property but if I’m gonna be waiting for some random chance it shows up I’d like to have some kind of idea.
@united I would be happy to correct it for you, business efficiency and organization is one of the areas I consult in.
@united This was not just a long checkin, this was procedural &amp; avoidable. Additionally staff could have addressed it &amp; did nothing. I have traveled the globe &amp; it was like a TV skit (bad). Everyone in line was laughing at how bad it was and making jokes at your expense.
@united How will I be compensated for this EXTREME delay? Laws in the EU require passengers to be compensated...
@united And it was set up so once people got their bag tags, they had to backtrack thru people still in line, in order to get to the actual bag drop. All this while you had multiple staff members standing around doing NOTHING. It was definitely NOT your finest hour. it needs fixing.
@united You really need to fix your checkin / departure process in Orlando. I executed my online, checkin in advance, prepaid for my checked bag and still had 1/2hr wait in line to print my bag tag and drop my bag and there were only maybe 18-20 people in front of me and 4 kiosks.
Welcome to day 6 of not getting my luggage back from @united. Gone through all the loops. Even reregistered my claim for my lost luggage. Didn’t know it was that hard to get a bag you left in one city to the city it was suppose to go to. Glad all my Christmas gifts are lost.
@united my UA 998 flight has been delayed almost 5 hours now. Any updates? We can’t keep sitting on the runway!
@united Probably because you used contractors to load bags versus proper UAL employees. Well done. Again.
@united FYI flight 344 from honolulu to IAD did not have any non-meat fresh options for food, and no barf bags. made for a great flight with my kid who got sick 5 hours in.
@united we arrived 40 minutes before our flight #4493 and we’re told we can’t get on the FLIGHT EVEN THOUGH IT’S NOT BOARDING YET!!!! HELP!!!
@united never flying with United again after this. Missed a connection and Now my flight is the next day, for the second time this trip.
@united So what I’m hearing is a no? Or a not rn? 🤔
Umm hey @united why did I have to pay a bag fee when I have your credit card? I haven’t had to pay for 3 years. Why did it change now?
@united I’m was on what was formerly known as UA396 here in Honolulu. What is the maximum value on hotel vouchers? Is the Pres Suite at the Hilton Hawaiian Village out of the question or...
Lawl airplane musical chairs on @united flight to PHX: -Originally in Econ+ window seat with row to myself 48hr+ before departure -12hr prior, got someone on aisle of row so moved to aisle seat of (empty) row across. -almost full flight at boarding(!!), Okay, that was sudden
@united My family (4 people) is at the airport in Cancún being told we *don't get a free checked bag per person on our return flight - even though we *were given a free checked bag per on the way here. Care to explain the discrepancy?
4 out of 5 doctors recommend @united
@united - whatever happened in the past few weeks...your systems have screwed up continuously from loosing my confirmed Lufthansa upgrades for a 20 hour outbound flight and now getting downgraded from economy plus to economy for return. #1K and likely leaving you.
@united Yes eventually we found it with our two exhausted children in tow.
@united Yep, and they were filthy. Seat pockets have had garbage also recently.
@united Premier 1K member here- please help me!!
I want to thank @united social media for their great service today.
@united Do you have a per diem so I can buy like clothes?
An entire empty row of economy plus and this @united flight attendant won't let anyone sit there bc it wouldn't be fair for people who paid. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ customer service is a lost art.
@united I gave them my contact info and address but they don’t know when my suitcase will get here
@united Seriously, DM me the call center or wherever address and I will send the banana bread 🤙
Another reason @united is the worst - a bunch of car seats came out of our baggage claim. Husband inquired with baggage people as to where ours was for 40 minutes. Finally someone walks by carrying a seat and says “oh check the odd-sized baggage.”
@united My whole problem is that you would actually charge people so that they can sit with their family. We already have flown and it was a completely awful experience. I will never choose un-United again.
@united The crew times out at 3:15.... so I guess the flight will be canceled :(
@united Hey got a question. I have flight to the US with ~2h layover in Frankfurt. Flight to Frankfurt is operated by a different carrier. Do I have to check in my bag (23kgs) again at my arrival? My concern is the short time between both flights
@united Terrible experience trying to board UA 90 today. Flight was delayed 4 hours - they made everyone leave the flight saying we'd change planes and then now are making us reboard the original plane again. Ridiculously mismanaged
@united I'm not talking about guaranteed seats, I'm talking about your policy to un-unite families on purpose when we don't pay your ridiculous fee.
@united UA 609 &amp; UA 90 PS it is 3am
Shout out to the awesome flight crew of today's @united #UA881. ORD-NRT Sa-luute! Thank you! Happy New Year!
Amazing flight UA1600 with Philip @united
I just landed back at O’Hare. Glad that everyone including the Greendale Marching Band made it back safe on UA 461. Thank you @united for your attention to detail on everything during this Rose Bowl trip.’
@united Still sitting here at SFO an hour after I landed waiting at Carousel 1 behind a line of other flights. There are unclaimed bags everywhere but hundreds of people waiting around. This whole place is a mess!
a google flights filter to filter out all @united flights so i dont have to ever deal with their garbage "basic economy" nonsense ever again
As ever, @united, I greatly appreciate this direct flight from Dulles to Geneva. Thank you!
Multiple families were not allowed to pick their seats, leaving families spread all along the aircraft. I have never been so disappointed in an airline. Please get your shit together @united
I am so upset with the way that @united would handle this situation- and put the gate agents in that situation when it was unnecessary. (We even offered to pay for upgraded seats so we could be together, and were told NO and to deal with a gate agent)
This was my first time flying with @united and I have never met a more unorganized airline. We called four times over the span of three weeks to book sets together for our family- only to be told that the gate agent will have to book us together. A thread
@united no because your workers absolutely suck, they wouldn’t let my mom in the plane because apparently she was “too late” meanwhile there was a huge delay, no one was helping us , and everyone was extremely rude . and that’s not all .
@united I was specifically asking about how you calculate the distance between two cities, not the mileage earning. So for example, what method do you use to calculate the distance between LGA and ORD?
@united someone in management needs to know that Angel, a customer service representative on the Australian number, is quite literally an angel. She is the most polite, helpful customer service representative I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. 😊🙌🏻
@united I expect a full refund for your shitty workers stealing my moms mangos and cream, you think that shit was free?
@united our first encounter with you guys from LHR to Chicago for new year thank you for looking after us on UA929 and UA931 - your people do you proud and we couldn't fault you! XX
@united Hi. What method does United use to calculate the distance between two cities for the purpose of awarding miles?
First @united flights of the year and we’re delayed 3 hours. Hopefully not an omen to my flying year
@united From what I’m reading on blogs, forums and FB groups, you may see a mass exodus after this year and all that money will go elsewhere. It’s too late, people already feel shafted and will use up this last year of status then will jump ship.
@united Thanks for delaying my flight for 5 hours, miss connection, call to refund that leg, and my whole flight gets cancelled and refunded, and im now stuck in a city and your unwilling to help. CS rep didnt understand me......
then flying @united back home with my bf today they delay us for 7 hrs because of maintenance. said they couldn't do anything for us and ultimately changed the flight to a smaller plane, stripping my bf (and others) of his seat and forced him onto the waitlist? pretty messed up.
I'm a chill dude about things but lmao I've had like the worst week with @united . started out with them cancelling my nonstop flight to see family - putting me on a layover flight that would get me there 5 hours later without notifying me which is...normal for united to do? okay
@united Already left. Is there a way to make a claim online for damage to a gate-checked bag?
Huge shout-out and thanks to @united and their social care team, who rebooked my D's non-refundable flight back to college for free, due to a death in the family. Above and beyond service. ✈️✈️
@united The rebooked flight is now also delayed. Lands when the connecting flight boards. Spent an entire night stressing about the flight to have a full day of stressing out with United tomorrow. WOW.
@united Way to not only delay the flight, causing me to miss only flight home, but also took money for my charged seats and then separating my seats to different rows AND middle seats when I'm forced to rebook for the next day. AND getting hung up on! Great customer service there
@united oh hey, and now the rebooking flight is now also delayed tomorrow. What a surprise.
Choosing United for all your flying now truly means nothing to them. Their new system for earning loyalty perks all but explicitly says so. @united
United’s MileagePlus changes accomplished one thing, and one thing only in my mind – they marginalised the only people who actually were willing to fight for their airline and defend it, no matter how many times it had been dragged down the aisles. @united
In other words, chances are that other airlines aren’t getting much, if anything from a loyal United flyer. That’s worth a lot, even if the person isn’t spending $24k a year. Money out of a competitors pocket is pretty valuable… @united
Someone daring enough to fly via Chicago in winter, because their beloved United flies there is a promoter of a brand. They have bought into the ecosystem, probably tell their friends and at that point, United is owning the “wallet share” from that customer. @united
@united worst airline ever!!! So many things to say
@united you guys really are the worst airline. Last time flying with you. Don’t know how you stay in business. $500+limo drive to grand junction pay for another night in aspen. Totally unacceptable to treat customers like that
@united Way to not only delay the flight, causing me to miss only flight home, but also took money for my charged seats and then separating my seats to different rows AND middle seats when I'm forced to rebook for the next day. AND getting hung up on! Great customer service there
@united You guys canceled my flight and wanted to make me wait 3 days to fly out to my destination without no hotel
@united Sitting at DEN for over 8 hours waiting to leave on flight 735 and all you’re offering your customers is a $75 e-certificate and a $10 food voucher. You can do better!
@united you lost my luggage, not once. BUT TWICE. Should be ashamed, I hope y’all get discontinued/ run out of business/ what ever tf it takes for no one to fly with you again. Y’all are a piece of shit airline.
y’all got checked bag money? @united
@united Really should get your customer service on. Tried to give me a bag significantly smaller in size. My bag is over $100. Something needs to be done
@united You’re welcome, but you may want to change your initials, just for business reasons I thought AA was American Airlines 😂
yo @united your no carry-on policy is all sorts of awful and I won’t be flying you again since I don’t have to check my carry-on size luggage on literally any other airline (I know, since I’ve gone all over the country in the past two weeks without this problem)
@united I’m at the RSW airport. There is no one hear they told me to wait. It’s been 20 minutes now. Not happy
Hey @united was just verbally assaulted by 2 of your “agents” over the phone. Appalled at the lack of care. I am constantly purchasing upgrades and first class, not using points. Care to tell me how to rectify this issue? So brand loyal, so disappointed.
@united you gave me a electronic travel certificate for canceling my flight last Christmas Eve . It expires today but your site will not allow me to use it. Please help
@united Yes, at 10:10 pm. I landed at 9:40 p.m. I want a credit for paying for a carry on bag.
Was told to wait 20 minutes to be helped after the employee when off and talked with friends. Very professional. My bag has been damaged. Thanks @united
really hoping y’all do something about this @united customer service at airport hasn’t been helpful whatsoever
@united Oh totally I don't expect you to know. I'm puzzled that within the 12 hrs that the aircraft wasn't in service and my detailed report being promptly filed - it's still missing. I just get the sense that the 3p service isn't actually working correctly with all of the facts shared.
OMG PLOT TWIST: @united is sharing ONE CAROUSEL for bags from Houston AND Chicago. So now, as someone who paid for a carry on, I am waiting for my GATE CHECKED BAG AFTER checked bags from Houston. I was supposed to land at 6:40!
I’m so frustrated with @united 1st flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting so now get to spend the next 14 hours for the next in the Houston airport lmaooooo
Why did I spend extra on a carry on only to have to collect it from baggage claim?? To make matters worse all the checked in bags are being sent to the carousel BEFORE gate checked bags! Why is @united so inept at EVERYTHING it does
@united Thanks but that really won’t help much. Would love to get some of the money we paid back since this day has been horrible. Over $1800 to get my family of three to visit grandparents and now we’re dealing with a 19-hour travel day with a 2 year old.
@united I don't doubt that the team will keep looking. What confuses me is that I was specific in my report of where and when it was left (flight, seat, etc). If all of this information was provided and knowing it's the cleaning crew that would have found it - why hasn't if been found?
@united my flight from Chicago to Jackson landed 3 hours late because of bad weather. Fine, you can’t do anything about that. I paid to have a carry on. It was gage checked. Upon arrival at JAN, I have to wait another 30 minutes because they’re sending ALL bags to baggage claim.
@united I wish I could give United a thumbs up but I can’t I’m sorry - no one regardless of who they are should have to wait for 5.5 hours with multiple gate changes to get to their destination and my son is not a frequent traveler so he doesn’t understand - he’s tired and frustrated 😡
@united I'm a bit confused. I file my lost item report a week ago and my item still is 'missing'. Here's where I'm confused - the aircraft where I left my item ended flying for the day with my flight. How did the cleaning crew not locate it within the 12 hours of the plane not flying?
@united I am going home tomorrow with my family from seeing relatives. Is there anyway I can get a free upgrade for 3? Pretty please? I am a good customer!
@united, I’m a fan, but today’s been rough. Daughter &amp; her family are traveling from MFE home to DSM. 1st flight delayed so they missed 2nd. Rerouted; flight left hours late. Daughter has stomach bug; son-in-law anxious about flying; toddler is 2. Delayed again. 17 hrs later...
@united 5869 - was supposed to originally depart at 610pm - it’s frustrating only bc it’s a domino affect and this whole experience for him on United has been awful - and I was just notified he is delayed AGAIN
@united what is frustrating is that there is nothing I can do and my son an active duty US Marine has been stuck in IAH for over 5.5 hours and multiple gate changes - #WhereIsTheLoyalty
@united sent my luggage to Denver instead of Philly for some reason and they’ve scheduled two deliveries and never showed up. Wtf is going on
@united FF here. Flying to NYC on Sat from SJD with 3 kids (One 6 month old) and a hubby. Seats all over the plane, pls help! Thank you
@united Someone more senior was more level headed and handled this beautifully. Please expect crowd which might be flustered and for whom English is not the first language. We all want to get home peacefully.
@united . Will DM, but I want this info pubic. Flight UA-104. Date of flight: Jan 2nd, 7:15 pm pacific Event of sassiness: Getting seats assigned at the gate. The agent was very clearly not equipped for the high crowd. Thanks for the direct flight to India
@united is $350 worth upgrading two round trip economy seats to business when they’re only 10 rows apart?
@united Yes my bag is missing!
@united 35 post arrival and still waiting on carousel 4 at IAD to begin spitting out luggage. What gives???
@united United Airlines does not care about you luggage or more importantly about their passengers no one is capable of helping and when you speak to one person someone else tells you something different. Can’t rely on making anything on time nor even getting accommodations.
@united Got message that inbound flight got delayed because of crew but when arriving at Denver airport we spoke to a manager Mary Hatchfill she blamed it on the weather because the airline unable to give any accommodations because they don’t take any responsibility.
@united stranded at Denver airport without bag or hotel. Flight out of aspen delayed missed connecting flight Denver to FLL because “weather condition” have to spend night in Denver without airline voucher because airline incompatint of taking responsibility for their actions.
Hey @united. I love sass as much as the next guy, but can you have cool headed agents who understand what it means to board a 16 hr flight helping your SFO-Delhi flight?
@united y’all need a better baggage handling team here. Shouldn’t take this long to unload bags.
@united the worst airline with the worst staff.
@united Can i take a large shopping bag as a carry on?
@united But then there’s $25 booking fee. So why would I do that?
@united called the 1800 number and someone overseas that speaks no English can’t help.
@united stranded at Denver airport without hotel and bags. Flight delayed out of aspen airport because “weather related issues “ lost concerting flight to FLL now I have no place to sleep or clothes to change into. It’s disgusting the kind of staff you have.
@united the lack of customer service is appalling - our bags are still missing - for 4 days, there is no person to assist - only online forms- a disgraceful way to run a business
@united How can I get my 2018 and 2019 mileage plus statements? I called and was bounced around and told to try again later.
@united How come there is absolutely no accountability for airlines? Planes go in and out of service willy nilly, no repercussions for delays
@united it’s been 2 years since I’ve been dealing with my refun from my first class round trip trip to California and put in refunds and haven’t heard anything and I’ve very upset and I only got a 200 dollar voucher and was not satisfied
@united Gate agent said the plane had to be taken out of service because of computer issues. App says it’s because of a broken windshield wiper. Seems like a traceability issue or y’all just outright lie to customers
@united Nope, only more empty promises. No plane in sight, fairly certain y’all lost my bag, estimated take off and arrival keeps creeping up.
@united I did not notify the crew. Didn’t think that it’s the flight attendants’ job to clean the toilet.
.@united your app should be able issue vouchers, then people won’t have to take up space in the line.
Hey @united your mileage plus program freaking sux how do you email me my acct # then say it's not the correct # ?
@united so you’re telling me I’m delayed 2.5 hours because of a broken windshield wiper? Is that what classifies as a catastrophic failure?
We have now waited longer for a @united gate assignment in a stuffy, parked plane on the Denver tarmac than the length of our flight from Casper. One passenger I know has missed connection b/c of it.
Nos vamos a Cancun por @united
@united Never had a car sustain ice on the interior for over 7 hours, but maybe I’ve been spoiled. I’ve submitted my concern to Customer Care.
Well, @united has proven once again that they can take an excellent flight and flight crew that landed early in Denver and turn it I to a late arrival as we wait for a gate to be assigned. #SMH #neverfails
Dear @united please fire the engineer who put the tv controls on the arm rest. Did you guys at least field test this design?
@united Btw, the only offer was to get her on the next flt which is more than 24 hours from now. And she is too young to get a hotel room. She would have had to sleep at the airport (so I assume). But all anyone kept saying was “sorry for the inconvenience “.
@united No, luckily her connecting flt was delayed just long enough for her to make it to the gate. But it’s only by luck that she made it. No one was willing to help us. And the way in which she was treated is wrong.
@united UA5456. I just want to know I have a flight out of here tonight.
@united Thank you for the prompt response!
@united It wasn’t just the temperature. It was was a dangerous experience.
@united I've got a degree in Comp Sci. Yall want me to get in this 787 and fix the software issue? #ua735
First class upgrade! Thanks @united! United Explorer Visa!
Packing my carry on for Brazil tomorrow and i packed the full sack of 20 cuties... Let's see if this flies with @united 🍊🛫
@united Typical. You guys make me feel like you are the customer and I owe you my money and loyalty for the privilege to fly on your airline.
Lastly, when rebooking our next flight (after askjng for any other option to any other NYC airport this evening), Corey made a point to box our boarding time on our passes so we “don’t forget.” Disrespectful, negligent customer service. @united
Thankful for helpful agents @united Accessibility Desk to work through paperwork for my oldest’s emotional support dog. To God be the Glory.
What a terrible experience with @united - Not only a 4 hour delay to get to Nashville last week, but the pilot on this flight wanted to leave early, so the gates were closed early, and we were told that they finished boarding by the time we arrived.
Why cannot I apply my United travel credit to the flight I’m trying to purchase? @united It states United Payment Types are not available when I’m at checkout.
@united mahalos for once again taking excellent care of my family through Twitter, i love #UnitedAirlines
@united Like many people, I was delayed by winter weather after Christmas, getting stuck at ORD en route back to IAH. Wanted to give a shout out to Syed Rizvi at ORD who was patient and very kind despite a long line at the CS desk. I know it’s not easy dealing with all of us!
@united When are you starting the status match for 2020?
@united Your customer commitment “We are committed to providing a level of service to our customers that makes us a leader in the airline industry. We understand that to do this we need to have employees who like coming to work every day.” I’m waiting at Gate F98 (YYZ)
Thanks, @united After 20+ hours of travel, you couldn’t get our bag home from the final, shortest leg of the trip?
@united This is a REALLY shitty way to do business, period.
@united could you tell me how many times my flight will be delayed? on the 4th delay so far. UA 400, EWR-PDX. this is FRUSTRATING.
@united Happy Shout Out to Bernadette in Sante Fe for pleasantly reopening her terminal to go ahead and check our luggage after she'd already closed it. We were running late due to snow/ice. ❄️❄️🏔️🏔️
@united I’m sick and contagious and United won’t switch me to a later flight so I don’t infect my fellow passengers. So if you’re flying to NYC tonight from LAX...
@united still waiting to find a UA agent. Do they have a secret hideaway that they all run to when UA flights are delayed so they don’t have to serve their customers? I’m at Toronto Pearson airport and my flight is now delayed by 4 hours. I still cannot locate a UA agent.
The @united crew’s lack of attentiveness and unwillingness to help resolve the issue makes me want to fly elsewhere with my business travels.
Lost baggage, rude airport employees and flight attendants, and overbearing rules. You couldn’t pay me enough to ever fly a @united flight ever again.
@united I asked for supervisor Ace # V042692 who verified that unless I told them the names of transient airports they would not change my address
@united Now cust service said I never had previous miles. Furthermore I wanted to change my address and even though I answered all the security questions from profile they would not change because I couldn’t tell them the names of the transient airports I flew thru
@united, a BIG thank you to Mary in Reservations for her stress-free handling of our travel emergency earlier today!
@united Switched to United Club mileage plus credit card. When I did it generated a second account. Because the #s did not match I was not granted access into United club during intl. flight. Furthermore my 40k miles were not transferred over when United consolidated.
@united My family flying out of MCI (Kansas City) late tomorrow morning. How early should they arrive at MCI if they are checking luggage?
@united I’m at Toronto Pearson airport. My flight is delayed by 4 hours and no UA agent to be found at the F gates, at their counters on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Customer service?
Our flight had to be rebooked but btwn my anxiety making me check the United app over and over and Michael’s hard work we avoided getting stuck overnight &amp; instead got here 6.5 hours early!! 🤗🤗🎊🎊🎊🤗🤗🤗 thanks @united! And thanks Mixto the agent at ATL for being so helpful!!
@united living up to their reputation again. Waiting 30+ minutes because they forgot to fill the potable water. #unitedsucks
You know you're on a @united flight when you land 3 hours late, then still haven't gotten off the plane an hour later.
Ow on the plane over an hour! @united after this shit show I hope my luggage arrives unlike the last trip. For this we pay good $$$ yet noone gives a rats ass.
@united My daughter has a flight booked (return of a R/T) for Saturday morning to head back to college. Her grandmother passed away yesterday and the funeral is Saturday. Any chance of getting a flight change to Sunday?
@united This my friends is why I love #united airlines. I’m good JM. See you in ten days!
Hey @united. I was disappointed with the seat debacle outcome earlier today. But you redeemed yourself! Flight was overbooked, so you gave me a sweet deal to stay longer. Grateful for more family and beach time, and for your awesome gate agents at TPA. 🙌
@united DEN-SFO UA735, flying first, platinum member, regular international Polaris flyer. Flight is delayed by at least 90mins, no complimentary club access ( club is right next to my gate B32). Come on United - put the customer first! #unimpressed
@united Huge props to the agents who did everything they could to get us on the flight and the flight attendants who made us feel beyond welcome in the last row. Right now, there's nowhere we'd rather be.
@united And that doesn't factor in all the offers to help from people who follow us on Instagram and beyond. People offered their homes, their cars and their time to help if they could if we needed it. Thank you. We will return the favor.
@united From the airline agents, to police officers, to drivers, to flight attendants and random strangers, it was genuinely good people who helped us get from icy highway to flights home.
After enough drama to last the year, the girls and I are on a @united flight home. Josh will hopefully follow shortly on the next flight. The theme of today is that the only thing that can make an awful situation better is great people. We met many great people today.
@united called customer service to ask about free checked bag and not only was told no, was also told my priority boarding is being taken away as well. This is all after I checked in. The fuck is wrong with you.
Ok @united is upgrading my flight home so I guess I’ll stop talking shit about them 🤷🏻‍♀️
Thank you @united for issuing the exception for a refund. I knew that you would also come through with excellent customer service.
@united You mean the 6 am one? Ya I know you had one good person here. So excited about sleeping on the fucking floor with a 5 year old.
here we are again, with a delay... get it together united. i will never fly with y’all again.🤷🏼‍♀️😂 @united
Totally disgusted @united on flight 1758 with 175 people sweating everywhere it is so hot on this aircraft. Bathroom having issues to. Flight attendants cranky
Getting drunk in the United lounge - which spoiler isn’t really that bougey- so I’m just gonna keep tweeting at @united Bc they suck 🖕🏼
@united you changed my seat from a window to a middle and then delayed my flight nearly 3 hours causing me to miss my ride and dinner plans. After charging me $30 to check a bag because you say my ticket doesn't let me carry on a backpack. Not a great look.
Now I can’t order drinks because of this average turbulence...yet the flight attendant said as soon as we are in the air I can make you another drink after mine spilled...cool let me pay to upgrade just to sit here with no drinks or service @united
Hey @united! I just had the best experience with your customer service. Thank you SO much.
Can always count on @united being so disorganized at EWR for TSA... Ridiculous the line is nearly outside the airport
Question for @united Can I use a one-time United Club pass in Dublin? I will be flying economy Aer Lingus booked through United.
@united I bought a backpack flight from you guys, i was given no issues in Florida about it but in EWR airport they made me check my backpack and pay an extra $60. A small personal item sized backpack. Customer service was extremely rude and mocked me for
@united I understand that, as mentioned in my first tweet. It’s still frustrating to deal with as a traveler and it’s frustrating getting the go around now from several different responders who clearly are not reading my past replies 🙄🙄🙄
Sitting in first class @united listening to this racist idiot flight attendant yell in Spanish to a guy in the back who clearly isn’t Hispanic and is middle eastern and then talking shit about how they aren’t listening to her.and the peasant lady wouldn’t bring me more whiskey 😑
But don’t worry. @united generously gave her a $10 food voucher.
@united I sent you a dm. Check your inbox
@united if I buy a ticket in 2019 for a 2020 trip, does that purchase qualify for 2019 PQD?
@united True, but when the Lexus fails to sale, the Toyota dealer will reduce the price until it does! Anyone else experience trying to get a last minute upgrade on a United flight with available upgraded class seats?
@united If I fly I need special assistance with going to the airport to my Gate airplane I have special needs
Never flying with United Airlines again. The worst customer service experience I’ve ever had. @united
@united So if I take the 9:30 flight from ORD to LHR would dinner be served or only breakfast towards the end of the flight?
@united absolutely disgusted with your service. At bag drop at Newark we get tickets for family of four two rows apart, despite booking them immediately behind each other. Then bag drop want to charge $200 for 1 overweight bag!!!!
@united wow at DIA and your machines to check in bags not working. 2hr wait. Please you make TSA look great!
.@united I’m flying with your booking on ANA. They’re requesting I register certain information before check in but since I booked it with United I need to do it with United. I should already have that info on my account. What should I do?
@united flight UA888 was delayed, and we’ll miss our connection (Air China 905)... united people on the airport say next flight to Yangon is until Monday, we’ll loose reservations and most importantly, half of our trip in Myanmar... how can united compensate for this??? HELP
@united we had confirmed seats and you changed our flight now we have horrible seating and nobody is at the gate to help us.
@united I just wanted to let u know that ur customer service rep in the Philippines by the name of Alex Condeza is amazing!!!!!! I have no words to describe how awesome my experience with her was, I would really love to see you guys give her some recognition #united #alexcondeza
@united is trash. That is all.
Also @united... it’s helpful to post gate numbers online ahead of when you begin to board for a flight. Also nice to have folks at the gate announce THE GATE!
@united many car rental companies would let you take a lexus if it was just sitting there
Hey @united! Not sure whether she’s just a jerk or having a bad day or both... but the gate agent for flight 4396 (BTR) sucks! So rude.
@united im about to miss my flight because your shit service I’m EWR. My flight leaves in 15 min but I’m stuck still at TSA due to poor UA management of high volume days. Can you tell me how I can rebook?
@united Do you guys have a local number for United's DFW baggage claim? A delayed bag from another airline was rerouted to DFW on a United flight. Tracking says its at the airport. I'd like to see if its still in United's possession at DFW and potentially pick it up.
@united Want to thank you for the wonderful service. Canceling your flight not making arrangements for another. Booked in October. You guys suck
@united My daugther fligth from PIT to PTY on Dec 19, until today suitcase is lost; United said COPA was responsible, COPA said We NEVER recive the suitcase from UNITED; WHO is responsible for the lost?, You are parthners, and both need give us an answer. BAD VERY BAD SERVICES
@united flight UA1099 has still not taken off and I have a flight in Houston to catch (UA5). There no other flight until tomorrow....so I assume you’re going to put me on another airline home.
4 out of 5 doctors recommend @united
@united can you have someone on your CS team get back to me on a charge you promised to waive? This is ridiculous
Over 12 hours and still haven’t received my bag @united :|
@united UA1414 cancelled 12 times from MFE to IAH. First time, they cancelled due to missing screws on panel and we had to deplane. Reboarded and told there were issues with door. 8 hours later and part is still in Houston.
@united UA1414 cancelled 12 times from MFE to IAH. First time, they cancelled due to missing screws on panel and we had to deplane. Reboarded and told there were issues with door. 8 hours later and part is still in Houston.
@united I've been on hold for a while, and the last person who contacted me said she was calling so she could "locate my bag," even though it was clearly stolen. That was two weeks ago, and still no updates. Let's hope this call is more useful.
@united yes - I need someone to pick my dog up in Denver and bring to my house - I will DM you now
Alright @united, first flight of the new year... hoping the friendly skies are indeed still just that! #1K
@united Your airline and customer service people impressed my mother over Southwest.
@united That's it? How about "we'll improve our policy to have the ground crew actually check with the flight attendants to see if the bins are full".
@united I’m very much aware of the guide and competent enough to read and understand . However, let me be more clear this baggage claim information is not working in your system
Shout out to @united, first trip with the boys and we get bumped to first class.
@united Now we got a email saying that the flight departs at 2 PM, after saying it was canceled. I spoke with customer service they said for sure it was canceled. We are nowhere near the airport
Dear @united - we are clearly off to a good start. After 12 days away, we won't get home in time to pick our dog up. Due to delayed flight from Newark (the coffee maker did not work and lead to 1hr 45 min delay) - but hey ho - I only have another 131 000 miles with you this year
@united Do not want a connecting flight. Booked this in October
Seriously, seems like a flaw that there’s no way for me to use the .@united app to rebook the connection I know I’ll miss *13 hours in advance* - isn’t that more efficient than making me physically talk to a stressed-out gate agent to fix this? My problem has a simple solution!
@united Quick question on partner airline PQPs for an article. Is the RDMs used for calculation the base number or would a 1K earn a higher PQP than a general member?
@united I had tweeted a complaint about the handling of our flight as a whole (each staff member I personally dealt with was great).
@united (tweeting from UA 632 at the moment so I mean solidarity)
@united I put in my application for customer service in st.louis. I was wondering about the status of it. I would love to work there.
@united And if the Lexus had to be driven to the same location I was going with the Toyota, why not? You fail at analogies.
@united On flight 1652 going to Atlanta. John Hillen in First Class is absolutely incredible. He has an amazing personality coupled with exceptional attention to detail
It seems a little odd that I’m online and connected while flying to Mumbai, but I supposedly can’t rebook myself on a new connecting flight from Newark to Boston until I land. It’s 2019 and all. cc .@united
hello .@united please help me get home - my flight from Mumbai to New York (UA49) is delayed so I can’t make my connection from Newark to Boston (UA2320), and since I have the Internet I’d really like to sort this out *before* I land in 14 hours
@united Just sent you the DM. Thanks a ton for your help
I’ve now been in the Houston airport for 4 hours, with still another 4 before my next flight. Someone gimme a good show/movie to watch plz 🤠 oh and, @united I’m still mad at you for ruining my first day of vacation #fuckunited
@united The baggage claim info isn’t working. Is there another form of compensation? This is insane .
@united get your shit together, it’s 2020.
Apologies to the nice lady having to hear me mutter Naughty Words like a dark mantra as I desperately try to figure out how to rebook myself onto a later Boston flight because my .@united Mumbai to Newark flight is, inevitably, delayed
Help - I’m going to miss my @united Airlines connection from Newark to Boston at 7:00 AM (UA2320) on Jan 3rd because my flight from Mumbai (UA49) has been delayed. I need to get on the 9:30 AM flight. I cannot figure out a way to do this via the website. HELP ME OBI WAN
@united no.I eventually made it home, but now my full time job is getting compensation &amp; reimbursements from you bc no help
@united Just arrived in New York on your Vegas flight. I just want to say how lovely the trip, cabin crew and plane was. It was a pleasure flying with you today. Thank you so much.
@united Yes I did last night
@united Was just shy of Platinum this year on miles but didn’t receive any sort of end of year offer like usual - can you look into it for me?
@united ...American Airlines, left his phone on the plane and received a call in four hours. What gives??
@united December 27th, I filed a claim for a lost wallet on flight 202 from ORD to OGG, left a message with the lost and found, files claims in your website and appealed for help on Twitter. I have not received a call from ORD lost and found. My friend, who flies...
@united scanned my bad but never put my bag on my flight which has my keys in and I now I can’t go anywhere or even get into my apartment 😩😩
Hey @united . Is there a reservations customer service phone number that can help me in the US? Your reps in the Philippines can’t understand me and I can’t understand them. Frustrating for all.
@united Thanks for your response! I paid the shipping fee on December 16. Is this a normal length of time to wait? Or is something wrong?
@united I was under the (mis)understanding that the PlusPoints would offer upgrades on every flight, but would require more points for more desirable seats/flights? Apparently not, same as the old Global or Regional program...usually waitlist. So, what's better? I don't get it.
@united: Why did you change our allocated seats prior to check in? I paid to get the travel agent to have the seats allocated, and viola, when I check in, I was assigned the worst possible seat, away from my family, whose seats were also changed #notfair #badcustomerservice
@united WORST EVER customer service! Lost baggage now 30 hrs. No compensation no answers no nothing.
@united No. I want to go home. Y’all simply just suck.
@united This has cost me 22 hours for a 2 hour flight.
@united Give me my money back. I’ve been in a shitty Tennessee airport for 22 hours due to your pilots forcing the flight to delay so that they themselves can timeout and not fly.
from personal experience don’t fly with @united because it’ll take you over 25 hrs just to take a 2 hour flight. #unitedsucks
Hey @united, Leo Sherman is flying my plane today: ORD to PHX. This guy is awesome! Please commend him for outstanding work. Deserves to be recognized for his engaging, outgoing personality.
I forgot @united once had a low-cost airline named #Ted.
Oops, meant for that to be @united!! Sorry!!
@united not to mention we use your credit cards and such. All to be cancelled if we make it home.
@united I want to pre book my seats from Düsseldorf to New York. The flight is tomorrow and I want to be able to sit with my partner. United day I have to sort with Eurowings and vice versa. Over twenty calls and still not sorted. I’m playing airline ping pong
@united The next day? Or another airline?
@united hi! Tomorrow’s flight only has 41min between my connecting flight. I don’t have much hope I will make it, but it’s the last flight to Toronto on united that day. Help!
@united I reconnected with another individual who is helping 🤞🏾😬🤞🏾. I would, however, like to inquire about the possible remedies for accidental, made in haste, under duress, and/or other contextually relevant circumstances surrounding Basic Economy purchases
Shoutout to @united for an upgrade and goodie bag for my mileage plus anniversary! ✈️
I will never ever fly @united again.
@united I DID! Can’t get any answers and no one knows where our luggage is. 27 hrs without now! WHERE IS MY LUGGAGE!!! Will I be compensated
@united I was about 1500 PQM’s away from elite status, any way you just give it to me please? This for Premier Silver by the way.
@united Please check your DM.. sent feedback on my current flight. Thanks.
@united Worst airline company. Shame it's an American company.
Learned the hard way to never fly anything other than delta today. Thanks for being a fucking sad joke of a company @united
@united why weren’t we allowed to get our luggage and take on shuttle yesterday??? Been without luggage for over 26 hrs! Ridiculous
@united WHERE US MY LUGGAGE??? Been missing for more than 24 hrs!! In vail and can’t even enjoy or get on slopes! Can’t get anyone to answer phones. #united airlines 😡😡👎🏿.
@united I was exposed because the cabin was not cleaned prior to my flight boarding, this is unacceptable.
@united thanks. Now all i want is to maintain my global services membership!
@united Yes. I know it would usually take 7-10 days but this is beyond a complaint of my seat was broken or you ran out of Diet Coke. I was exposed to a bio hazard, I had someone else’s vomit on my hands for half hour before I could wash my hands. Who knows what diseases I was exposedto
@united Do you all train customer service agents to end chats before answering questions? #waitwhatjusthappened
@united Hi! Ive just sent you an DM please read it
Another @united gate change! More exercise!
Funny how you try to be streamline but @united won’t let you check in early and forces you to see the desk cause you DONT have a carry on??
Lastly I’d like to add that I have filed a claim with @united ... a few days ago, I understand it’s the holidays so there are probably less people available to respond immediately but 🙃
@united i requested for a refund but i am yet to recieve it. The document # 0162480377378
@united We just had to de-plane for the second time and our flight will now be delayed by 6 hours. It is unfortunate that you do not value your customers time or money.
Hey @united on Dec 12 one of your flight attendants spilled a pot of coffee on me and was told I would receive compensation for the burns &amp; damaged clothing. Nearly 3 weeks later and still haven’t been contacted or compensated, what’s the deal?
@united We are talking to your representatives on the floor, but please explain why do my tickets get cancelled while your team on phone is "assisting". And we are running from pillar to post with a sick child
@united another round of pathetic service. We call you a zillion times.... no solution.... you put us on hold for hours at length.... no solution.... now we call for assistance and you change my itinerary 🤔. So United id in the job of creating problems when we ask for assistance
@united I was exposed to a bio hazard on my most recent flight from New Orleans to Chicago on 12/29/19. I would like to speak with someone. I tried to go thru your online request and asked via twitter to help yet no one has gotten back to me.
Today has got to be the shittiest day. Thanks for ruining my plans @united
This led to hours of delay and eventually @united couldn’t resolve the issue so he ended up staying the night in Dulles (they did provide him with a hotel and meals, thanks) ... his new flight was rescheduled to leave IAD at 5:20 PM on 12/29/2019 (24hours after original flight)
@united I hope to. You know, when you all decide to have one!
@united I haven't received a flight confirmation for a booking a made recently
It all started on 12/28/2019 — my father (a 65 y/o man I should add) had travel plans to go from Washington, DC (via @united ) to Brusselss, Belgium (transit stop) to Freetown, Sierra Leone (final destination) at 5:50 PM EST — there were many complications with the plane ...
Happy new year friends, I hope your 2020 is going well. I’m here to share an unfortunate story about my customer service experience with @united airlines over the last few days
@united hey may I query something with you all
@united Happy New Year! I was hoping your 2020 resolution would be to have on time flights.
@united It takes a lot to genuinely enrage me, and this was not the way u wanted to start the New Year.
Looking forward to a lifelong battle with @united to get my money back on a flight I missed, due to operational failure and incompetence on their end
HEY @united y’all have mentally unstable pilots and 1st officers who need to be FIRED, flight attendants who are RUDE &amp; i have been stuck in an airport for 2 days, no other flights available and all i get is a voucher for another flight on your shitty airline??? I WANT A REFUND.
@united Seriously, even if your flight cost was 1$ I will never fly with United. I was treated like trash recently and absolutely no acknowledgment from the United Staff. They literally laughed at me. I cried. I had to buy another ticket with Delta to get out. Inhumane.
@united I left my green Barney’s jacket on flight 1820 yesterday (BOS-&gt;LAX) in first class overhead bin, seat 2A. I filed a ticket (15777888), have you seen anything? 👀🙏🏼
Really @united? My flight got cancel and you want me to spend 24 hrs in the airport with a child? Just because you didn't get a pilot? #TantitaMadre
Hey @united I am once again stuck in an airport for 8 hours due to missing my connection by 1 minute but your customer service rep said there’s nothing they can do to compensate missing the first day of my vacation ? 🧐 🤬
I'm on my @united flight to Denver and the pilot just came out to personally greet us this morning. What a pleasant experience! Now I'm ready to take off :)
@united How can I get a copy of bag fee receipt that never printed at time of flight? Thanks in advance.
Reminded why I don’t fly @united last night. 6hr flight. No TVs on plane, WiFi and entertainment not working. To top it off we had a medical emergency and it was turbulent.
@united Apologize for not responding. Not only didnthe flight have direct tv for free, but the majority flight was able to watch and cheer for game!! Thanks all!!
@united has lost my bag! Happy new year to me!
Today's airport adventure: @united Agent: ID Please Me: *hands her my South Dakota license* Her: *GASP* I LOVE SOUTH DAKOTA! My daughter in law is from there! Since no one else was in line we had a short conversation about her visit to South Dakota. Left me smiling as I left!
@united That is what I am saying, there is never an update!🤦🏿‍♂️
@united Thank you, Elizabeth, on flight 4922 Memphis to Newark. You are a wonderful flight attendant and made the trip enjoyable.
@united Flight 294 High 5️⃣ to Patti. Thank you for exceptional service! #friendlyskies
Any friends with @united systemwides that will expire in Jan and want to share them let me know!
So @united I went to check in for my flight today and instead of a 6:45am direct it is now a 6am with a layover 😮. I sure hope I’m getting some sort of a refund for that change. I booked the original flight specifically bc it was a direct.
@united 4 of us took UA 2320 yesterday. No TVs working. Very rude crew did not help or even try reboot?
@united huge appreciation from my wife and me for Beth H at the customer service counter at ORD concourse B/C! She has smoothed our some potentially devastating issues with a lost bag and done so with a smile! She deserves an award or bonus! #unitedairlines
@united How do we get compensated when our flight gets continually delayed?
@united Do you know when we'll be able to use PlusPoints for ANA and Luftansa flights again? Your online form has removed them, and only lets Copa flights be upgraded right now.
Shame on you @united for the despicable treatment and service on your flight from Brussels to DC. Giving someone food they are allergic to is unacceptable and being rude to that person for YOUR mistake is disgusting. Money over customers, right?
@united I didn’t take an 8:30 am flight for fun... I took at 8:30 am flight because I have a shoot today which I am now missing. Your employees mistake is costing me thousands of dollars.
@united And why was a standby allowed to board as I was second away from removing my battery?
@united My question is 1) why was I allowed to fly from LA from Newark with said lithium battery but not the other way? 2) why was I told at check in it was ONLY an issue if my back was checked and was fine for carryon?
@united your Mileage Plus system is giving out wildly incorrect miles today. Must be a glitch. I just received 350 base miles for UA179 EWR-HKG!
@united Wouldn’t know bc I can’t get there. Wake your pilot up he’s 3 hours late.
Uh @united, how is it that I get bumped from the seat I paid extra for to a worse seat further back that I don't want? Someone give you more money? Nervous flier checking in.
They are playing coldplay music on my @united flight from Newark to Houston ! Day made!
@united The entire flight does not work. Not my seat. Upgraded to Polaris for a family of 5 and this is what I experienced. Traveling with children on a 14 plus hour flight like this is disappointing after paying so much.
Hi! I'm about to buy an economy class ticket to fly from Zurich to Guatemala City. I have the question that if a connecting flight is delayed or missed, will booking the next flight be an additional cost or will you take care of that? @united
@united I really don’t want to hear sorrys. Second time in two weeks. WHY IS MY LUGGAGE DELAYED AGAIN??????? Who do I need to speak to to get a refund?
@united I am doubtful you will be helpful but I will be open minded!
.@united I hate to Twitter rant but #unitedairlines can do what they want! Changed our flight without texting us! We finally need a Airline Passengers' Bill of Rights! Rules like they have in Europe is not too much to ask for.
Twice in a row @united. I need a refund on fees on both flights. Poor service. No food on international flight and no leg room and you all can’t put some luggage on a plane???????
@united An extremely rude lady, part of your staff, yelled at a non english speaker lady passenger at the entrance of the baggage check in area at IAH (Jan 2nd, 6:30am). Train your staff BASIC customer service skills
.@united You changed my (and fam) non-stop flight without sending a text(!) to a lousier one with a 40 min (very short) connection! I am travelling with a toddler. These things matter. You have no shame. Two screw ups within one month!
@united I hope you can give me free flight for my wife and daughter. #WeFlyUnited
@united Feel free to call me - you have my number.
@united Four hours in and no official update...
@united delayed flight resulted in changing flights, paid for first now sitting economy to CUN. can I get a refund??
@united Ahh ok, thank you for your time.
4 /4 flights @united #MyUnitedJourney within 6 weeks had delays (over 4 hours), even a cancelation. Today's flight UA961 seems to be no exception (no UA fault, passenger got sick). I'm aware it could be much worse, but maybe I'll refrain from flying (UA) in the near future. 😁
@united hello and happy new year! I was hoping you can answer a question for me regarding flight credit. Is it possible to use my flight credit from My Trips for a vacation for a hotel through the United website.
@united All I am saying is that you could provide an alert while booking flight. 9 passenger everyday are missing their flight.. something is terribly wrong somewhere!
@united Yes, and they said they couldn’t turn it off because it was the only lighting they had.
@united If I add her flight in my United app will that mess anything up? Or will the reservation stay the same?
@united Just lost my upgradeto a 1k given ual new rules. Since I can only make gold or platinum I am a devalued customer. If u can’t make 1k better find another airline. Thanks ual for trashing me. Hello SWA a better airline
@united That's my feedback. I'm not wasting time on your website.
@united hi there! How can I change the frequent flyer program on a booking? I want to use Airpoints (Air NZ)
@united She will miss her connecting flight in EWR and also has health related mobility issues. Can you help somehow?
@united But my passes were valid until 01/11/2020. It's ok, not a big deal.
@united 30 minutes before boarding. Seat open in first. I'm number one on the list and no upgrade. your new mileages system is penalizing me because I do CLE-LA. So now I have to do segments instead. I'll cancel my chase club card and take Southwest because I have to make stops
@united Of course we will try, but it will take time to deplane. If you can have the gate agent hold the door a bit to make sure we get on I’d appreciate it. There are no other flights to RTB today and I’m with a family of 8.
@united atleast have charging ports on the longer flights. Waiting for my dead phone to charge once landing was a hassle.
@united I’m with a party of 8 on 2037 to IAH connecting to 1434 to RTB. Scheduled connection time is 53 minutes and we are pushing back at EWR a bit late. Please do what you can to help make sure we make the connection. Thank you.
Starting a new year with an upgrade EWR &gt; LAS. Thank you @united
3rd flight in a row without my special meal being honoured 🙃 @united
Wow that’s the worst plane ride I’ve ever been on if you wanna fly direct to India, DO NOT fly @united
Already stuck for over 2 hours on an @united plane in Berlin because they can't find an oxygen bottle for the plane. No resolution in sight. Really?? Would have been faster and cheaper at this point with a connecting flight.
I’m such a nerd I can’t wait to fly ahhhhhhh ✈️ @united
@united I request you let go of the luggage you have withheld for over a week now. My flight was from MSP - BLR on 26th and I still do not have the luggage. Horrible experience
@united I haven’t. I filled something online but do I still have to call?
@united - Worst flight experience ever. Your pilot didn’t show up. 4-hour delay. No real updates &amp; those provided were not in the destination language. Unprofessional crew. I have status with you and seriously reconsidering a new airline for #2020NewYear
@united At this time 3:15 AM we are still are hold inside the plane waiting for a First Officer . The gate agents Did Not made changes to for those of us with connecting flies. According to them the pilot was already in the airport for a 2:30 AM departure
Extremely disappointed with my flight from ORD to LAX tonight @united. Definitely cannot recommend and probably will avoid United going forward. I know I had a Basic Economy ticket, but the non-existent leg room in the LAST ROW and complete lack of amenities was abysmal
Lost my bag! What to do next? @united
@united can i do a SDC on a flight within 24 hours of my original? would love to go home tonight instead of the next morning 🙏
@united No! I ain’t that stupid 😂
@united Serious question, if I were to take it what would happen?
@united It doesn’t say anything about turtles 😒
@united Soooo I can’t take my turtle? It’s tiny though and I have it’s legal info 😐
@united I AM HOME ... Sent from my kitchen floor which is as far as Ive made it so far
Does anyone know what rules @united might have regarding traveling with a turtle?? I want to take my little Leonardo home with me
Stranded in SF thanks to @united who promised a bunch of shit that wasn’t true (getting us a rental car or taxi to Sacramento) and our bags are lost and in Houston. What a nightmare.
Tips to travel in 2020: Don’t fly @united
@united Thanks so much. You guys are awesome!
@united You could try now, or are you just spouting platitudes from your playbook?
@united Yeah, invent a time machine and don’t leave empty planes parked at gates for morning flights; everyone but the bean counters would think that planes with passengers on board come first... not ease of morning departures
@united It’s a good thing I have a choice when I fly! #MillionMiler earning status on other airlines now!
Not entirely sure why I’m flying @united #polarisux as many disappointments as things done right.
@united gate staff at G7 were great And hopefully my bags will make it.
@united I request you let go of the luggage you have withheld for over a week now. My flight was from MSP - BLR on 26th and I still do not have the luggage.
It looks like the @united customer care is not interested in resolving any issues.
Still fuming over @united yesterday how is lingard and matic still getting played ? Lindelof and Maguire havent formed a partnership there is no trust no backing from each other Rashford looks tired and needs a break Martial moved a bit better yesterday everyone else was average
@united Was about to...then saw my flight from POS to MIA skyrocket from $196 to $1100+ within mins
@united And I’d like my checked luggage too!
Good fuckup @united, no gate after the 1:40 delay, we’d all like to make our connections, thanks a bunch for making this a lot more challenging than it needs to be, if I miss the flight by 10 minutes we’re going to have a talk
@united Not with that circus of a company you run 😂 I’d literally use any other airline
@united I was supposed to go on a trip with my family today. So excited. Delay after delay and now the trip is cancelled. 2nd time I've tried to fly with United, 2nd time delays and cancellations have ruined our trip. We are beyond sad and discouraged.
@united Really?! One bag drop at Heathrow?!
@united If I die here please fly my corpse back to AUS on N36272 thx
@united Staff arrived after 10pm. Completely unacceptable.
@united it’s a shame that United don’t have a first officer for flight 1009 to Bogota on 1/01/2020 . The gate agent is continually reporting that they don’t know where he/ she is. It’s this serious ?
@united June 2020!! Hawaii trip with parents, brother &amp; his family, and aunts for my parent's 50th Anniversary!
@united If you can't do anything else could you at least magically deliver some Sudafed or NyQuil or something to this gate, I may be dying
@united I could have driven home by now lol
"we appreciate your patience, we'll have another announcement in 20 or 30 minutes" c'mon @united just cancel the flight already, I know it's the last one tonight and you're cheap but I should have been in my own bed an hour ago 😭
Long story short- 24 hour planned trip to Aruba turned into 3 nights due to someone activating the emergency slide on my outbound aircraft when it arrived into Aruba. @united tried, but it was a comedy of errors that melts us on the island. They ended up ferrying and empty
@united — on flight UA 722, which was pulled back to our gate right before take off. Stuck on the tarmac for over an hour, and yet no food/drink offered, despite flying first class! #UnitedSucks #PoorServiceOnUnited #UnitedAirlines
I’ve taken so many red eye flights with @united but this is the first time I don’t get a blanket? 😭doh!
@united I could use the app even to browse for movies, but I would try to play them it displayed a message about my device not being compatible (Android 10, running the latest chrome version)
@united Why is this in my timeline?
Thanks @united for the random free upgrade to first class. 2020 starting off great! UA3599
@united Wow what did Milton do??? 😁😁😁
@united If you had been truly sorry you would have bothered to call, text or email me with a status update during the 3 days I have been waiting for my luggage.
@united wow 60 minutes after 544 landed at RDU and over a hundred people waiting around for bags trickling off one by one. Poor showing...
@united your new app won't work on Android 10.0 (for in-flight movies), am I right?
Had 2 of my flights delayed and was 10 hours late to my destination. To add to it my luggage wasn’t on my plane when I landed. @united
@united Ali, the flight attendant on tonight’s 6:35 pm flight UA704 from IAH to EWR was an angel and did magic tricks for me and she’s the best and I just wanted to tell you.
Hey @united, want to publish some up to date and accurate details on #283?
@united +++ There is a striking difference between your company and competitors when it comes to customer service... I advice fellow passengers to choose a company that actually cares about their passengers. United Airlines does not.
@united Worst Business Class customer service I have ever experienced. Bags lost for 3 days. You have not been in touch once to update me on status as you promised. When I called this morning and waited 1 hour in line, I was promised delivery today. But no bags so far. +++
@united Hi, I was replying to a message from a few days ago.
@united Should I bother filling out the inevitable survey I am sent asking "How was your experience on your flight to Jackson?" When it's pretty clear that customer satisfaction is the lowest priority?
Curious why @united charged me $240 CAD for a ticket which was $146 USD ($190 CAD), when they found out my credit card was Canadian. They refused to bill me in USD. "Billing origin" sounds like "effects discrimination based on national origin" to me!
@united pretty poor parking job at the gate here on #2327 in #JAC. Seems like it's the first time anyone has seen snow...in Wyomong...I may make it off the plane 12 hours after I was scheduled to be here...but also maybe not...
@united our #plane landed in #GrandJunction instead of #Aspen and now there is #no #bus to take us to Aspen from here 😣☹️
@united Let me say if it was $50 bucks I wouldn’t be so mad but $200?!! Like what! That’s a flight ticket
And yes I’m bitter, we could have another day with Jose but @united isn’t happy with me just paying the flight difference I need to pay a ridiculous change fee
@united “Plan your vacation “ but if things change you’re stuck with your flight unless you cough up $200 and flight difference 😒
@united if my bag isn’t back by 4:35pm est on Jan 11 someone is going down. Complete incompetence
@united Been a long day. Thanks for your prompt responses. Happy New Year.
@united why charge a change flight fee??!! $200 is ridiculous
@united at Guatemala airport , 200 people and not one worker or company representative around , what’s going on ?
@united Also- Annette at the baggage claim service in Denver was very very helpful and professional. She saved the day.
@united Finally got a supervisor. Was told now they will deliver our bags to the hotel. But before supervisor was asked for we were told impossible for reclaims to be delivered. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@united I appreciate your acknowledgment. Truly. Not making a lot of headway here with customer service reps.
@united Still waiting on supervisor to explain why I have to wait 2-4 hours for my bags. Which are here somewhere in the terminal. Was told they can’t bring “ reclaims “ to the hotel we have to stay at tonight???
@united I’m at La Aurora Intl in Guatemala City for flight 1208. Got here 3 hours before the flight as instructed. An hour later, there is a huge line and no agents to check in passengers. What gives???
@united Hit me up with deals to Mexico 🇲🇽 from YVR
@united trying to check in at Seattle. No one at 1k check in!!??!!!
@united In boarding group 1? Be ready to wait with 100 other people after united’s made up groups for people with ~status~
That sad feeling when you wake up New Year’s Day and your @united app has reset and shows all zeroes. Guess that means it’s time for adventures....
I have spent the first 20 hours of 2020 fighting with @united which appears to have no idea where my bag is. Shouldn’t even be surprised.
On Saturday, I'm going on an 8 hr plane flight with my husband and our 2 yr old. It will be her first time flying. Advice? Thoughts and prayers? Thanks! #ToddlerLife #parenting @united
@united What for??? Now the other flight my family is taking is 39 minutes late on 'waiting for the crew' ... Why can't a single trip be eventless???
@united Well it’s going to be too late then.
@united Customer service clearly doesn’t not exist at United
@united Your reservations team said they would contact the team at Dulles they lied. They did not contact them
@united I sent over all the information hours ago, I called your reservations team and have spoken to ground staff at Orlando and Dulles all unhelpful.
@united The same issue I tweeted about several hours ago that none of your staff are willing to help with
Hi @united is your ticketing system back up? I need to confirm some details of a ticket I changed a few days ago.
@united Thanks. Next time I fly this route I'll get a lounge pass, just in case.
@united worst airline experience in customer service. Ryanair are more helpful than this
@united we were told they were 4 free seats 2 hours ago and now they have magically disappeared.
@united followed the advice given and currently speaking to your staff at the check in gate who are being really unhelpful.
@united . So i paid online for what? I don’t get it!
@united . Basic economy. So not allowed a carry on. I purchased a bag online when I checked in. But before tsa they wouldn’t take it. I thought it was because I only had a personal item and a carry on. I told the united lounge employees and they said to talk to the gate
@united Thanks for all of your help today at Dulles airport with helping my family return to Fort Lauderdale well taken care of. Glad to be a platinum member!
Delay, delay, delay. This time I'm stuck IN Houston, rather than trying to get here. I do appreciate @united sending me updates via the app/text. I've had 7+ hours of delays for a three day trip, though, and I'm tired.
@united was able to turn my 45 min flight into a 2 hour one. Happy New Years by myself in Denver :(
. @united refused to check in my bag I already paid online for.
@united ...I just realized I am flying United in 3 weeks to celebrate being re-United with my birth Mom for one year! Seems appropriate United played a part in uniting us! 🥰
@united I was one of the lucky ones who made my connecting flight. Half of the other customers are not going to be that lucky. Also no help from anyone on the ground, what so ever.
@united Thank you so much 👍
@united Rochester, NY to Chicago with three days notice. This was more than double the normal fare. Not sure how this all adds up and makes me second-guess my choice of airline...
Yo @united, due to the death of my grandmother I had to fly last minute to Chicago during the holidays at a super elevated ticket price. Then we were delayed five hours due to “flight preparation issues” which apparently means that our flight crew didn’t get enough sleep...
@united The Lounge staff *has* been nice, and they’ve worked out the shower situation.
@united Except nobody should trust those ports from a security perspective. And my charger delivers higher power output. So #fail on security and technology.
@united Flight 744. Finally received luggage after 45+ mins
@united Yea I did talk to them, at 9 am when I landed, still no word on where tf my snowboard is, disqualified from the snowboard tournament
@united Been waiting for checked baggage for over 40 mins at #LAX terminal 7 baggage claim. Ridiculous wait time with dozens of people still here
@united Atleast it’s the right time to make a resolution!!
@united Thanks and wish you the same. Now to extend this to your 777s as well!! 🙂
@united you guys lost my fucking snowboard and the day before canceled the flight to Redmond 50 minutes before we were suppose to take off, no help whatsoever with a hotel or getting my bag back fast. Still don’t have any news on it
@united Not this one where you forced me and only me to check my roller board which I have carried on hundreds of flights when the flights bin were basically empty. Not sitting and festering in Newark. The staff was the opposite of friendly. This is the third problem in a row w ua
@united your guys customer service is terrible
The “Polaris” experience is significantly lacking at #LAX, first the distinct lack of welcoming at checkin, to the inoperable facilities in the lounge. Why does anyone fly @united? Rhetorical question, this Million Miler has just about burned all reasons to keep flying them.
Soooo pretty much @united Airlines never placed my luggage on the plane and now they can't fix the problem..... What in the fuck is going on over there??
@united We called and recieved the same message from Monday night. We want to speak to an actual person and not an automated voice machine...
And just like that, my plane was delayed! Can any of you remember a time when mine or Paul’s flight wasn’t delayed!?!? Yeah, me either! I will certainly be glad when we don’t have to fly once a month to see each other!! @united #united #alwaysdelayed #neverontime #tired #ua3844
My 9 week old son looked at me today and said “Dad - since @united raised the dollar spend requirement for 1k to $18,000 are we going to have to go back to boarding in Group 1 with the regular people again?” Honestly didn’t know what to tell him.
@united I honestly have never felt so utterly betrayed/shocked by the ineptitude of an airline in my entire life. On the trip out my flight was delayed and United did not hold the connection for 5 min, despite their advertising. Now they list my son as an unaccompanied minor!
@united Several days you responded with a canned response and then nothing. Gee thanks
@united flew 1st class and the crew wouldnt/couldnt give me the stoopwaffle offered in coach🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Sorry, @united, had to buy your stupid wifi for $29.99. Back now. It’s also awesome that you can’t stream video but the fucking united advertisement online is perfect quality. Priorities.
@united Yes i have been rebooked now for a flight departing at 6:49 tonight instead of 10AM tomorrow this is still beyond ridiculous.
@united luggage app is saying bag tag does not exist....so how do I find my luggage?
@united lol okay they didn't charge him after all so at least that is good. He is running now to a 6:15 flight, but why wouldn't they rebook him instead of telling him he would have to be overnight?? United really botched this one. I'm not emailing until he is safely here!
@united I haven’t heard back from someone in almost 3 hours. Hope to hear soon.
instead of having me wait 72 hours. Did I get unlucky with customer service or is this normal? @united (16/16)
agent at the counter would have helped as much as possible..paid rental .. possibly even booked me on a competitor's flight @united (15/16)
I'll wait until tomorrow to see if I can get on a flight. I can't believe United so completely different than Delta. Delta's @united (14/16)
$200... Looking at oneway flights and a rental car will be around $500... money is tight as I spent too much for Christmas. I guess @united (13/16)
going to be almost 72 hours from my original reservation. The agent said no dice.. she could refund the return flight only for @united (12/16)
United and asked for a refund because I planned on renting a car to Reno and booking a Delta flight back to Birmingham since it's @united(11/16)
talked to the TSA agent and he said he probably wouldn't be back and I should call before tomorrow's flight booked up. I called @united (10/16)
@united All the COOP advertising like #StarWars isn’t gonna make your torture tube planes more tolerable. I feel sorry for your employees. Merging w/ competition has been terrible for consumers. #UnitedAirlines
inconvenience. My flight today has mechanical issues.. the agent came out and said call United and disappeared for a few hours. I @united (9/16)
sleep in the airport in Denver. I rescheduled for the next day "today" and United upgraded me to first class for my @united (8/16)
plane was several hours late and I was going to miss my connecting flight. I was told I could either reschedule for the next day or @united(7/16)
hours later I arrived in Mammoth California a few hours before Christmas. My return flight was scheduled for December 31st... The @united(6/16)
for $93 from Enterprise rental. I had to go the long way around as the direct route has road closers because of snow. however, 4 @united(5/16)
until the 26th. I wasn't willing to stay in an airport over Christmas and not with my family ...so I rented a car @united (4/16)
United's feedback only allows about one paragraph... I guess they would rather us share feedback online. I usually fly Delta but @united (1/16)
@united should be taking off at 6:15pm not 10AM!!! flight was cancelled
@united he did try and work with you. they sent him to a kiosk to rebook a flight and charged him for it!
@united Heading to Oberammergau in September for the 2020 Passion Play and treating my mom and my mother and father in-law 😊
In short, @united couldn't handle my wife getting a new passport and deleted her Platinum status and rebooked her in the storage area with our checked bags.
ATTENTION ALL NEWLYWEDS: Whatever you do, do not make any travel bookings for your honeymoon or the six months following your wedding with @united. The name change process is too complicated for them and they have no way to cleanly update your name. Causing absolute chaos for us
@united nothing like spending an hour of the first day of the new decade sitting on the runway at Newark for an hour...
@united That sucks since I finally made 1k this year.
@united How can you help make this situation less painful? Is it possible to get complementary lounge access? My family and I would appreciate some relief from this long wait.
@united y’all are the WORST!!!!!!!! Was supposed to fly out of Houston to Knoxville at 2:45 now it’s been delayed to 6pm!!!! I won’t get there till 9! I still have a 1.5 hour drive home after that!!!!! 🚮🚮🚮🚮
@united how has UA1157 not taken a delay yet she the inbound is 90+ mins late?
I don't know if God exists but JP from @united, yes ! My husband and I are really #thankful for your #precious help and absolute #kindness ! See you on board ! #Thanks again JP and #unitedairlines ✈️🗽🏙️
@united He has but this is really frustrating this was his 18th birthday gift and we had to now cancel the surprise dinner reservations.
@united Gate 40, Terminal B her name is Dee Dee S
@united More than frustration at this point! Second delay due to maintenance issues and now crew at their federal limit! United should be more on too of this! I’ve never had this issue with JetBlue or any other airline!
@united Have already asked and been told apparently there’s nothing that can be done via Twitter
@united trying to book a ticket. Is your service down by any chance. It’s not letting me to finalize the transaction after the card details are given.
@united That page still doesn’t say anything about online checking requiring checked in bags. At least I didn’t find.
@united not impressed with lady on the desk who said you haven’t bought seats you’ve paid for travel.
Our @united flights back to California keep getting delayed first flight was canceled now rebooked flight is delayed twice likely making us miss our connection. This is absolute bulshit from a horrible airline.
Pardon my language but FUCK @united AIRLINES! Looks like I won’t be getting home today. This is major bullshit. Am I going to miss my own wedding?????
@united I’m going to Iceland! 😃
@united I understand the restrictions but does it say that each passenger can only check in online if they are checking in bags?
@united heard it will be another hour delay this is ridiculous!!!! I’ve never had this issue before with JetBlue or Delta!
@united help!! My son is supposed to meet me in New Orleans he’s had two mechanical delays on two different planes now they are say flight crew is nearing duty limit! I need to get him here today!!!
shoutout to @united for the 1st plan to NOLA being rejected due to maintenance issues and now the replacement plain after being cleared by immigrations having issues as well. now on the plane and they’re doing maintenance and the crew said they’re almost at their limit...
. @united the lines at Denver International are ridiculous. Minimal staff it’s heinous
@united Not yet I’m not done with my public bitching.
@united most disappointed that no-one seems willing to sort our seat dilemma and am expected to do an overnight flight with children in seats that don’t recline and were not the ones we reserved.
@united Sorry for my delayed response! It was flight UA4758
@united This shouldn’t be an extra step at an understaffed airport like RDU on one of the busiest travel days of the year
@united I am now going to wait in a 30 min line to get a boarding pass Very disappointed and hope I don’t miss my flight
@united my husband &amp; I are traveling business class from Tampa to SFO with an infant, and are in separate seats. Requested the attendant (Greg tucker) at the gate to help us page one of the passengers sitting next to us to ask to swap seats but was told NO! Service at its finest
@united I am very grateful for that. Trust me.
@united having an issue with seats on our flight to London. Can anyone please help?
@united Took off from MSY, but now on my flight to Providence we are delayed because, as the pilot so thoughtfully informed us, “There’s a loose screw on the outside of the plane.” Do we, as passengers, truly need to know the plane is falling apart? While we are waiting to take off?” 🤔
@united has cost so much $$ and so much pain over this holiday. For #airline considerations, choose otherwise!! All of 2019 worked for #premierstatus but treated 3rd rate &amp; fees out the ***! #christmasblues #unitedAIRLINES #sonotworthit #brokenheart
@united You canceled my flight, caused me to miss NYE, and now I can’t get back home for five days?! Not cool
@united We’re currently on MCO to EWR, flight UA293.
@united Hey United. Delayed for 6 hours because of a “mechanical issue” that you failed to notice on time? Thanks to you people in my family will get docked pay for tomorrow. You just lost a customer.
@united you guys fucking suck. Literally nothing but delays with you
@united We did get a refund! No worries there ✌️ Your Twitter is more consistent than the flights, ty
@united Your flight crew told me they fixed the problem. Not good.
@united Thank you. Do you know if SFO Lost &amp; found is open today? My calls keep going to voicemail.
@united We did all we could, even checked your partner airlines We're just driving
@united belated but thanks! they found the missing flight for me and had my account fixed!
If you want to check luggage and have it put on a random plane without any notification or consent, and then be told you won’t receive a refund for baggage fees because of the problems caused by this, be sure to choose @united #unimpressed #unitedairlines
@united just had the GREATEST customer service experience with Michelle from Gunnison Airport. Thanks for starting off my 2020 on a great note 👍🏼✈️
#FlightUpdate @united flight 4644 from Denver is experiencing a departure delay from Denver, ETA into Gunnison is 3:20pm. Contact airline for more info.
@united is there a diff between “United Economy” and “Basic Economy” ?
@united Huge #Shoutout to the wonderful staff at the C7 United Club who were able to rebook my itinerary. Thanks and appreciate the #FriendlySkies
@united gotta love when your flights get cancelled twice and can't find any flights in the surrounding STATES that work It's only happened every time I've flown with you guys
@united Thanks for your quick assistance and I’m looking forward to flying Friday.
@united Great thanks so much for the clarity!
Fuck newark airport and fuck the airline industry in general @united
@united Thank you for your diligence! You seem to know more than the travel assistant at the assistance desk!
@united one hour on the phone with you and still not resolved ... TELL ME WHY
@united Thanks! Spoke w/UA Rep (despite 45 mins hold time😢); have file # &amp; will bring damaged bag to airport for inspection as instructed Other than much longer wait time than stated during initial message which said ~15 mins, rep was courteous &amp; professional #airlines #paxex #travel
This was the first &amp; last time I EVER fly @united !!! They KNEW my flight was delayed over 1 hr and I hauled my ass across Houston airport to arrive at my gate at 2:52pm (last call was at 2:50!!) and they wouldn’t let me on! #🖕🏻united. #DeltaAirlines #Forever
@united can you please help me with my reservation . I have DM you . Thanks so much
Can I use my plus points to upgrade an award flight? @united
4 out of 5 doctors recommend @united
@united giving the people what they really want - a second round of drinks containing only OJ and water. #thankyou #fluseason
@united can someone explain how my 12 year old was left on his own to find his way through baggage claim AND customs when you were paid the unaccompanied minor fee?! When I called to complain, I was told I had to wait 2 weeks to someone to contact me!
@united Thanks for your feedback. I can be a le to speak in English too 😉 So, my prob is that i need 2 seats side to side for my back flighr from NYC on 02/29/2020... Apparently I can't do it on your website. By the way, I need a luggage and can't add it too... Thx for your help 🙏🏼
@united Took family to Maui to celebrate an anniversary, birthdays and a graduation! Awesome trip!!
@united I will book through a company from here on out that wants to provide excellent customer service rather than Adrina’s snotty behavior. Funny it wasn’t an issue when I flew out of Kalamazoo on Thursday. 🤦🏻‍♀️
@united There’s something to be said for poor customer service to good customers. Especially one who even has your credit card.
@united Flight 3997 to Newark from Charlotte
@united Couldn’t have done it without you and #OnePass... er... #MileagePlus or whatever!
@united No connecting flight, ohare to Newark
@united In addition, when my husband complained, the male customer service attendant listened to him (but told me there was nothing he could do). This is blanant at #sexism and disgusting behaviour. Shame on you. Any #probono #lawyers interested? #sexist #womendeserveequaltreatment
Shout-out to @united for making things easy in helping me change my flight!
@united Damn lazy bot. Never taking any direct action. Always delegating your work to humans. What’s the point?
@united Out of curiosity, are we able to use Plus Points to upgrade award tickets?
@united This is amazing!! Thank you united!!
@united I took an EWR-TLV flight on Sunday &amp; you only credited me 1450 miles? Say what? Not even nautic miles. Please explain. And you better not be a bot!
@united Brussels airport needs to work on their boarding procedure. Hundreds of people pulled out of line bc lacking security sticker-no announcement, no info other than the sign at the gate. Please add this additional security information to the app and the emails!
Had an upgrade but delays caused me to have to switch flights to tomorrow. Hoping @united comes through with an upgrade for my flights tomorrow. 🤞🏻
@united funny how Adrina H at your service counter in Fargo charged me for my bag when I have your credit card and no other agent has made me pay. She had the attitude to boot. Horrible customer service. Maybe she needs a refresher on the perks of having your card!! 🤬
@united I have a small carry on bag with me which has swiss knives in it. So TSA asked me to check it in. At the united kiosk i was asked to pay $30 for the carry on bag. I understand its a charge, but even when I am loyal member with united, I thought they would wave the charge.
Well today has been the worst New Years Day thanks to @united
@united That’s another issue we’re dealing with (IAH-YEG). This is for my family and I from Houston to Cancun.
Dear @united, we didn’t expect to spend the ENTIRE day of 2020 at airport due to ua#484 delay. #notcool 😐 At least let us know if you will cancel rather than dragging us along like a bad date.
@united please for all that is holy in 2020 make it so I can enter my 8 character visa number via the app instead of an agent/kiosk every time 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
@united checked my luggage but the app is saying the tag number is invalid and also not showing up under my reservation. any ideas?
@united 1. My name is RIGHT. THERE. 1 r, 2 s.
@united spring for the full cans of seltzer
I'm just a girl with gold status, standing in front of her 6x delayed @united plane, asking it to take her home to her cat.
Hey @united why is UA 510 from LAX to EWR making an unscheduled stop in Omaha?
@united My last flights on Battleship Grey aircraft, all three on one journey A320 TPA-ORD 777 ORD-DEN 757 DEN-PDX
@united Hey United. What is going on with flight 6165 Dallas to Houstonm It is now 7 hrs delayed due to a tire change. The tires have been here since 1030. Thx.
@united Want to pay for my airfare on the dream vacation?😅 #LawStudent
So, since I complained about all the delays when we left, I should mention we landed 20 minutes early coming home. Happy New Year @united!
Hey @united, there are a hundred gates at EWR airport. Why do we always have to pick the one that’s still occupied or isn’t ready?
Hey @united would you be so kind to upgrade my seat for my flight tomorrow? Would really love to experience business class this new year once in my life.
@united You really don’t!!! So stop replying. We are losing an entire day of our five day vacation. In 2.5 hours you couldn’t get a diff plane.
@united Just filled out the forum. Hoping you all find it like you did my wife’s engagement ring I lost.
Thanks @united for making my refund request quick and easy--the fast response was also greatly appreciated. Happy New Year!
@united Have not... how should I do that?!
@united I left my iPad in the seat back pocket of 17k on UA50 MAD - EWR. Can you help a brother out?
@united We would just like to know what’s going on. No one has said anything since we got on an hour ago.
@united Doesn’t give me back the day I’m losing.
Hey @united, I’m flying with y’all to Orlando this summer. I wanted to know if Stroopwafle’s were available onboard. Cheers to a new year!
@united we have no clue as to why we are sitting here an hour late in leaving. Why put us on the plane if it’s not mechanically safe to fly???!!!
@united we have been sitting on the plane in Houston heading to St. Louis for almost an hour. First there were mechanical issues which we waited 45 minutes for in the terminal. Then more issues once they got us on the plane. It says we have left but here we sit at the gate...
@united Also... we’re getting married today! 🤵🏻👰🏼❤️
Did you know? If you fly @united and have a round trip ticket but you miss the first leg of the trip, they cancel your return trip back anyways even though you paid for both? Then you can spend hours on hold with them just to have them tell you you need to rebook
@united my flight out of OKC to Houston is now on a 1 hour delay (we’ve been waiting on the plane)...I am going to miss my connecting flight to go to Huntsville. How are you going to fix this?
@united Just booked CPT !!! Dreams are possible with United !!
@united is the worst airlines 💯
@united I have never been more anxious and worried while flying in my life.
@united Please leave at least a few direct flights from DAY to IAH per week. There was demand for the service, those flights were occupied. Again, Dayton loses out.
@united Flight UA2022 has not taken off and bathroom reeks of urine. Clearly not propetly cleaned before a 4 hour full plane flight. Your flight crew should not have to deal with the mess.
Dear @united, please inform your staff that IAD is in the Eastern Time Zone. Not Central. Kthx.
@united Looking forward to your taking me to Amsterdam for my birthday in February!
@united Traveled to Puerto Rico on December 26th. Bought online. Had to pay for bags again at airport due to "glitch". No overrides even with receipt? Stuffed all liquids in one bag to check. Doing same on return to avoid fees. Will I get a refund in cash for unused bag check?
Hey @united, it would be fan-fucking-tastic if when I called to get my refund, and you directed me to a website where I could submit, the form would actually, you know, SUBMIT when I click it. How the fuck am I gonna get an error message about connection failure for this?
@united great job with all the updates #killingit today! Thanks for getting me on my way to HI safely 😄
@united Once again a delay!!! Flight 1055. It’s a shame it happens, we had plans that must be cancelled.
@united you guys messed up my new year for no reason switched my seat at the last minute so I couldn't be with my family on new year and gave no reason. The flight wasn't even full. I will never fly United again. Fuck you!
@united From the flight deck: “we are going to depart at 9:15 am” Now we wait another 15 minutes with no movement.
@united just booked a flight with my 8 yr old son den to nrt. No other seats to select and we aren’t sitting together. Any help would be appreciated.
@united did such a bad job advertising the limitations of Basic Economy that they don't even let passengers check in until they arrive at the airport lest they arrive with carry-on luggage. This makes travel that much more stressful
@united Okay how many retweets for first class tho?
So Ilthis is 2nd time I got someone’s flight information and seat numbers. It was annoying so I called United, and customer service a few minutes ago was told don’t worry about it because it look like a glitch! Well @united please look into this!
This is really the most unprofessional flights ever @united
@united make a customer happy? My son flew in your Star Wars plane Miami-ORD Mon nite, didnt get a pin that was handed out. HUGE SW fan! Any possibility of sending him one?
@united over 2 hours late on departure now. Why don’t u update with REAL departure time now👺
@united Update from the flight deck: “it would be very irresponsible for me to venture and guess how much longer, but maybe another 30 minutes.” So please, sit in your crammed seat, let your children cry and enjoy.... 🤬
@united The entire trip including the flights were awesome. But by far my tour of the DMZ was my favorite.
To make matters worse, because there were no more @united flights leaving that night, the customer service desk was closed, which meant I had to call customer service, sit on hold for half an hour, and then pay for a hotel out of pocket.
So @united deliberately held my ORD-YYZ flight for nearly an hour to wait for connecting passengers, causing at least a dozen people (including myself) to miss our international connections. The next available flight for me: 24 hours later and with an added stopover.
@united Oh, not to mention it’s a 5 hour flight. So, yes it sounds like a terrible idea to sit on the plane for an extra hour.
2y ago gave up my @united GS due to poor customer experience. After spending $70k in ‘19 they want $2k pp to return fam from Belize 2d later so purchased new tix for $670. Unused return leg can only be used for flight from Central America! Shopping for new Airline in 2020, tips?
@united Oh I fly all the time now. It was just getting over that fear. You all do a great job.
@united Yes of course. Is it possible the app is malfunctioning?
. @united are United airport lounges open at Denver International Airport today?
@united No pic but brief description. Best flight was my first one. Was traveling to Boston for work. Serious anxiety. Almost could not get on the plane. That flight changed me for the better
@united I checked a bag in Edinburgh but bag tracking on the app isn’t finding my bag tag. Does that mean my bag isn’t on my plane? I just landed in Newark and noticed the issue.
.@united’s flight 546 out of San Diego is delayed bc they needed to locate a part and then have it replaced. How do you not know this before we board a flight, especially with small children? Garbage is what you are.
On @united this past year, we have had planes delayed without reasonable cause due to -- missing aircraft, cleaning vomit on planes, and now inappropriate engine maintenance. The European Union by law would award compensation to passengers for this type of behavior.
@united #Beer and #Football is always the way to start the year off! #RoseBowl #OnWisconsin
@united Yes, I will DM momentarily. Thanks.
@united Hands down worst Polaris service I’ve experienced to date on Flight 961 today. Not a friendly crew.
@united ┏━━┓┏━━┓┏━━┓┏━━┓ ┗━┓┃┃┏┓┃┗━┓┃┃┏┓┃ ┏━┛┃┃┃┃┃┏━┛┃┃┃┃┃ Please no delays for my flights ! Hi ┃┏━┛┃┃┃┃┃┏━┛┃┃┃┃ ┃┗━┓┃┗┛┃┃┗━┓┃┗┛┃ ┗━━┛┗━━┛┗━━┛┗━━┛
@united I upgraded 2 tickets at Washington Dulles on 12/27/19 going back to Heathrow and you’ve charged me for 5 😂 can I have my money back pleeease. Call it a new year favour 😍🎉
And thanks to @united for treating me really well.
@united I want to give a big shout out to Gina at OGG who helped check us in yesterday and to Hope on our ORD-FNT flight that just landed. Some of the best customer service I've had from an airline!
@united hi there. I’m due to fly to NYC in 3 weeks but I broke my foot last night and I can’t fly...what’s the best thing to do?
@united happy new year! It’s January!!When will you release the details on your new status match program?
@united Just sent you guys a message - we are still waiting for the bag which said would be delivered by 5:45am it’s almost 11am
@united Does the entertainment systems on Polaris Business Class international flights carry CNN or BBC or other live channels?
@united Thanks for getting our vacation started off on the wrong foot
@united flight 5860 to Santa Barbara is delayed for a “crew scheduling issue”, so either United completely forgot to schedule a crew for this flight OR the crew wasn’t told their schedule. Either way it’s pretty shit.
You had one job @united refuel the plane that arrived last night before we boarded this morning UA212👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺👺☠️
@united Haha very funny. please get us in our way on schedule first. Don’t make us wait at airport gate for an hour after departure time on January 1. Then we can talk about actually being on a vacation
Dear @united, day one of the new decade and you are already screwing up crew schedules and making passangers wait at the airport gates for hours. What a promise that you didn’t keep.
@united It’s a long flight, but your crew is awesome.
@united you’re welcome. if only your self check-in and missing TSA pre-check responded as swiftly.
It’s 2020 and @united is still the worst airline in the US.
Forgot my passport this morning. Hadn’t realised til I got to the airport. Thanks @united for the excellent customer service and help. Happy New Year!
@united Please don’t fly us on a 737 MAX
@united gatta be the worst airline ever man 😒😒😒
@united my flight time was changed 6 times this morning. I’m tired. Help me. Still no flight. The automated system keeps tricking me 😭
@united I am frustrated at avoidable issues. Key point there. Don't need help at this poin, thanks though, but United continues to the make the same couple of mistakes over and over. Just trying help you become a better airline.
@united Thank you. It’s been a long trip and I just want to get out of here.
@united in China right now leading a study abroad and need someone reach out via direct message about my reservation
ok why isn’t my bag tag showing up in your app @united
@united Wait until First class customers realize they are only getting breakfast for 11 hours - better make it good!
@united Okay once again first flights in the morning should never be held for maintenance. You actually do that after it arrives the previous evening. You're seating remains atrocious too..
Love it when Continental, er, @united starts your year off with an over 2 hour delay for an 11.5 hour flight. Thumbs up, Continental! This is why I don't fly you anymore!
Two weeks ago my flight out of Chicago was delayed over an hour. Today my flight back is delayed almost 2 hours. Dear @united, I just want to go home.
Is it possible to drop dead from stress? Our flight home got cancelled and my wedding is two days. @united is a piece of garbage dressed up in airplane clothing.
@united I did, they did give me a File Reference Number which worked yesterday but when I tried to check it today it says the number/information is invalid!
@united I booked a flight from Wichita, Kansas to Mumbai,India. After getting my journey delayed by 22 hours, I landed in Mumbai just to find out my bag has not reached Mumbai, it's been 3 days and my bag is still missing. Utter Disappointment!
@united Good morning! Happy New Year 🎊. Let’s hope that the skies are, in fact, friendly today. #210 #4540
@united Will do - we’re on a slight delay already (UA1142) so hopefully it doesn’t hinder my running through the Denver airport to catch my next flight!
@united why do you overbook flights??? And why if I purchase 2 tickets, why do you separate us???
@united i opened my app to check in and my flight has been changed without my knowledge. i'm not complaining, just confused. i was originally on UA241 from chicago-seattle and now it says UA635?
@united We're not talking right now
@united This is absolute insanity, I literally left the bag less than an hour ago. It has a priority tag. Why is it not travelling with me?
@united Yep technical issue. But no communication. Boarding now so just hope to make the connections. But still, buy some airbus craft in the future :)
@united I’m boarding the plane and I didn’t get priority boarding. What is the point of pay 95usd very year for the United milage plus card if I’m not getting the benefits. I will use other credit cards that have no annual fee and cancel my United card. Agents were rude to me too
@united sucks. A bunch of people just missed their flight because the baggage lady couldn't get her shit together. Now I have to spend another day with my family
@united And as usual no info at the airport. No visa for China, plane just landed 2 hours ago. Looks like we will be stranded 2nd time in the last 5 weeks when using United flights.
@united It’s 1:31 PM here in Munich as we sit on the aircraft with no updates.
starting off the new year with a delayed flight from @united and might miss my connecting flight 😎
@united It was in my original post. 🤦‍♂️ UA 953 MUC to ORD.
@united Thank you! And I must say, that was the fastest check in ever! You guys are doing a great job at Newark airport 👋🏼💯😍
I’ve never been more excited about an upgrade in my life. Thanks @united I’ll take an extra large water with an extra ice and a double shot of water, with a water floater please🍾 #earlyamflights
@united pretty awful service at IAD to start the new year. Won't be back after that.
@united Can you explain your policy? What is the difference between a cat, a dog and a bunny in a carrier? Larger dogs often aren’t even in a carrier. Flew from SFO to CDG in the spring and there was a dog at my feet from the passsenger next to me.
This was not the longest flight for me, let alone @united, yet we left São Paulo last year and just arrived in Houston. The service was great and the crew announced the arrival of the new year midair. Let your dreams fly in 2020.
Yay, thanks @united for a bunch of Star Wars spoilers in a ubiquitous safety movie.
@united No they didn’t I am your customer at your location how you tell a customer to make a phone call to your customer service and your customer service tell you to call chase and you are also waiting for your flight worthless
@united #upset passenger over not ordering a kids meal. Family seating in row 10 L. I don’t care if you r Global Service or the President you have no right to Scream at the flight attendant. #i gave up my meal so your kid can have the non-kid meal. #2020NewYear you ungrateful
@united I paid for an upgrade on an international flight, and I have never in my life been treated more rudely by flight attendants than on that flight. For the amount I paid, I expected much better.
Yo. I’m boutta be 28! Lemme FUCKING buy flavored juul pods @united states government
@united robbed me of $150. They are dishonest sacks of shit.
@united Exactly but It was scanned before they noticed that I was flying other airline that wasn’t star alliance 😔
@united I’m on flight UA349 and the male flight attendant is so rude for no reason. He lacks manners and shouldn’t be working with people with that attitude.
4 out of 5 doctors recommend @united
@united I missed out on 1K despite flying over 100,00 miles because I didn’t spend over $15,000. I fly out of LAX and my airfares just aren’t as high as smaller regional airports. Can that requirement be waived as I have UA credit card and million mile lifetime. Any hope for me?
@united It was valid but they just said call chase it was scanned prior but I was not teaveling on a star alliance airline so when I try to use later did not worked
@united Weight restriction on plane. Bags were removed - we got notification when we landed hours later.
@united Yes my united club pass was not accepted therefore I was not able to enjoy the privilege to be a united one pass member.
@united how can you just change my paid &amp; confirmed flight from Denver to SFO on flight # UA 243 on jan 1st’ 202 without any mail or messages ?
@united how can you change my paid schedule flight without informing me? I was on UA243 and need you guys to get me back on my scheduled flight.
Thanks @united for helping to end 2019 on a high note (sarcasm)! Taking all of our bags off the plane so that your cargo could go instead - big win. We actually checked bags to help out since flight was so full and we were headed home. #neveragain
@united I didn’t catch his name, but the person who checked us in this morning at CDG was fantastic and very kind. Very much appreciated.
@united thank you for letting me and my girlfriend get home together on the same flight. She was routed with many layovers and you all let us sit together during the same DIRECT flight
@united If you upgraded me occasionally, all would be forgiven! However, SFO is a problem.
@united not a great look when your flight is cancelled on New Year's Day morning for a "crew scheduling issue". Seems pretty questionable... Now have to drive 3 hours across the state in wintry weather get out of town. Not happy!
It’s 2020 and somewhere @united airlines is losing someone’s luggage
@united #flydubai #customerexperience Never use Flydubai whenever you're traveling from Egypt. 1 have the word champion's in problem making ground staff. 2 doing their best to offer the worst, the most poring boarding experience u will ever have. 3 guarantees u 2 miss Ur #FLIGHT
@united I can share my worst
First @united flight UA180 delayed by 10 hours, now reached EWR and half the plane’s luggage can’t be found, waiting in the baggage claim area for an hour and counting! Could you have made me and my family’s travel experience any worse? #disappointed #poorcustomerservice
@united I will keep tweeting until we get our bags here at #ewr #NYE2020 #suckkss - aaah i just heard — belt is moving now - time to pickup the bags -
@united hey united do you even care about your customer- is this the experience you planned for your #customers gor #NYE2020
@united im here at the airport #ewr with my family and there is no sign of baggage on the belt - looks like staff is partying fot #NYE2020 #Travel
@united where the heck is your staff? Keeping us wait for our baggage at the belt for the last hlf an hours — #horrible experience at #NYE2020
@united Your employees at the United Club terminal C at the IAH are the worst with the exception of Karla.
@united Oh, and all after dinner drinks too 😜
@united Brand new Polaris svc, old plane, but all goodies &amp; amenities. Flight attndt not 100% sure of all offerings, so go ahead and try all 5 desserts! Dec 20, 2016 PHL-AMS Fun flight!
@united Yes, and they’re not even sure what city the bags in. They were sent to a city I didn’t even fly through and then there is no out scan
Hey, @united! The passengers near me yesterday on Flight UA1672 had a shouting match before we took off from SFO, and I was promised a $200 ETC voucher would be delivered to my inbox. You haven’t sent me anything yet. The flight was on 12/30/19. Should I still wait for it?
@united 2 boards/deboards, multiple delays, 1 aborted takeoff, cancels flight, 8 hours delayed day 2....36 hours to get a 5HR flight!! Then you lose my luggage! unbelievable worst travel experience ever!
@united And at 11:16, only 10 minutes less than the flight time from ORD to RDU, I have 5 bags and 3 sad kids who are going to miss getting to watch the #NYE2020 countdown in their own house.
@united She’s been calling but they tell her it’s “out for delivery”. The tracking information just doesn’t work with the websites you officially list.
@united Thank you. I hope they will be recognized for their great service.
@united hey guys with star alliance gold with Air Canada am I allowed extra baggage allowance on United flights ... please advise ... typically I am allowed 3 bags at 70 lbs, is this the same with United flights?
@united you the worst customer service imagineable - which is why I haven’t flown you in 20 years. But for once I thought, how could you possibly screw up a 1.5 hour flight from LAX-&gt;SFO and you managed to do it. Here’s to another 20 years of not flying United. #UnitedAirlines
@united 1 hour, 3 minutes. 3 of 5 bags collected. Priority tag officially useless.
@united Still waiting on your reply
@united You lost my girlfriend’s luggage and keep telling her it will be delivered today but every time she calls they tell her it’s in a different place. (She doesn’t have a Twitter so contacting on her behalf). Be better
@united Thanks. But I was in error, it was Kona, not Kauai. Sorry.
@united booked a trip on united airlines and they totally ruined my flying experience. going from sfo to bkk they first off changed my flight on the day of check in and when i got to hongkong had no record of my flight and could not print me a boarding ticket so i missed myflight
@united And now they’re unloading. 51 minutes. And no priority tagged bags in the first 20 out...
@united We’re now at 45 mins. Prior flight baggage has been completed for 7+ mins. My 3 exhausted children are a mess. At the very least, there should have been an announcement that we’d be waiting for 45 minutes. Only 40 mins shorter than the flight duration.
@united I had awesome customer service from Fatou and Jorge at the BNA airport ticket counter.
@united Ah, now they’re about to unload the flight that came in AFTER our flight. This is not acceptable.
@united doesn’t respond to direct messages after reneging on agreed upon terms and steal my money
@united It’s 10:40 and I can assure you that not a single bag has come through.
@united Terrible customer service. Friend landed in CLT Sunday night, but bag stuck in Newark. 2 days and multiple flights later, bag still in Newark. Bag ID’ed, but no one can seem to get it on a plane. Customer service zero help. Unacceptable!!!
@united And thank you for an overall great travel year. A few bumps and tribulations here and there but more positive experiences than not.
@united Already has....18 times. No help!
@united #worst airline ever. Moving elsewhere.
@united Epic fail United. Over 2 days and friend still has no bags. All customer service can say is, sorry, nothing we can do, Newark won’t call us back. Really?!?! 6 people with United status about to abandon ship. There must be a better airline out there.
@united No, I had to get a hotel, which I paid for the last two nights, since they canceled my flight and they were no more available until Wednesday night.. so I cancelled the flight and the service rep said my bags would arrive today in Hancock,
@united 😂😂😂😂😂 nope I’m stuck in Chicago. I was told my bags would end up in my destination this morning and they didn’t and they are apparently not scheduled for tonight’s either.
@united Well flight was cancelled yesterday and your customer service is not being very helpful with my bag service.
@united Can you confirm your policy regarding flying with a pet bunny in a small carrier that fits under the seat in the cabin? Is it permitted and is there a cost if that’s my only carry-on?
Not very thrilled with you guys.... @united
.@united please help. It’s been 20 minutes but people are tweeting from United.
@united I’m on the plane and need to DM
Can I get help with a connection and bags going to wrong airport? @united
@united Thank you for your prompt response. I sent you a DM. Hopefully we can get this sorted.
@united That was the number I called while waiting for a United employee to get to the airport and was left on hold for almost half an hour.
Guys, I really need help here. Why did the person on the other end leave? @united
@united It was remedied a bit. I don’t know why the cold air was blowing like crazy
@united But at least for all my time and effort to just get here I’ve been compensated with a whole 10 dollar meal voucher.
@united It feels like every interaction I’ve had with a worker has been a very helpful person trying to navigate a series of unhelpful and arcane policies and systems. I’m simply happy I’m flying back home with Alaskan Airlines and American Airlines.
Thank you @united for all the exceptional flight, cabin, &amp; ground crews, which got me where I needed to be this year! Best wishes for 2020 &amp; I’ll see you in the New Year. #unitedjourney #friendlyskies #unitedairlines #travel
@united is there a price match ? Just found the same flight for 100 less
@united Jorge Valdés in Guatemala provided excellent customer service to us. Please let his boss know :)
@united No, and I now know that I should have checked with them, but when my flight was rerouted I was told to check with United by a United worker. It wasn’t until I got here that I needed found out that wasn’t true. Also the phone line was so busy I couldn’t ask anyone there either.
I need help for a connecting flight @united. Urgent. Major delays all day and now my bags are in limbo.
@united Also, there was no baggage team present to report it to anyway.
@united Right after I tweeted I managed to find it, but that was entirely because of an Air Alaska worker, I received almost no help from any United workers, even after one finally came to the airport.
@united your gate agents for flt 1526 are amazing
We been in the airport since 4 pm and our flight keeps getting delayed 🙄 @united
I love wasting my New Year’s Eve night in the airport due to multiple ongoing issues from @united. United always fails me by having delays and issues with the aircraft. Hopefully in 2020 I’ll start choosing a better airline to satisfy my travel needs
Quick update. @united is easily the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. Seriously, they’ve added an excess of 14 hours to my travel time and to top it off lost my bags, and refuse to help find them. In fact the most helpful people in finding my bags are from another airline.
@united I added my TSA PreCheck number reservation, however I just checked in and don’t see it in my moble boarding pass. Can you help?
2019 is the last year I ever suggest @united to anyone, 2020, everyone I know fly elsewhere, I’ll have to explain in depth sometime why this is, BUTTTT yea just don’t use em in 2020
Hey @united I called last night to change my flight &amp; was quoted a price of $54,000 for a one way domestic flight in economy. I was told it was because the flight was over-booked. My friend took the same flights &amp; said there were plenty of empty seats. Was there a mistake? TIA
Nothing like bringing in the New Year stuck in the Cincinnati Airport 😡.. Thanks @united
Thanks for the upgrade @united! It was my wife’s second time ever in front of the curtain and she enjoyed it. 😀
What the hell @united did you give all your baggage handlers at IAD the night off. An hour and counting.
@united And I saw a 31 minutes delay first, then a departure at 7:30, now 7:45 pm. Not serious at all! So far, condemned to rely on you...
@united She is on LSD, AT LEAST
@united There is still one full year ahead to determine that, isn’t it?
@united All my paperwork said I had two tickets. The entire situation was completely unacceptable and the customer service atrocious.
@united and we have to pay the dog sitter extra for not getting back home when we were supposed to. Did I mention that these tickets were booked in September? Ridiculous.
@united This was a huge error on United’s part and that should have been acknowledged by an employee rather than having six different employees insist we were at fault. Now we have to take a later flight, our bags will be sitting at the airport much before we can get there.
@united Contd 4. Apparently having a reservation, confirmation numbers, and seat assignments were not enough and it was MY fault that the system had a glitch and screwed it up.
3/3 @united Contd.. There was no acknowledgment of the error in the software or in the fact that this situation never should have made it past the check in counter. Instead of taking responsibility and apologizing for the error
Contd .. @united ticket payment, even though my order had two tickets and the transaction I entered was for two tickets. Apparently having a reservation, confirmation numbers, and seat assignments were not enough and it was MY fault that the United SOFTWARE SUCKS!
@united Once we got to our gate, my wife was blocked from boarding because she had a “paper ticket” which apparently doesn’t exist. To make the experience even worse, the three employees at the counter kept insisting that the issue was our fault. the system only processed one.
@united My wife and I just had the worst customer experience flying from IAD to SFO with United. There was an issue with the kiosk when we tried to check in, but simply went to the Additional Services booth and were checked in, checked a bag, and had our boarding passes printed.
Let’s hope @united don’t mess my special meals up again tomorrow 🙃🙃
@united This was a couple years ago, but I did have a great flight!
@united Yes, I will DM you the ticket number done by your staff at DIA.
@united You're welcome. I'll definitely fly with United again👍✈
@united AA said to contact you even though we flew with them on the leg our bags never showed up. Please help us get our bag from Mexico!
@united Sadly, I did. Still no one has responded.
@united pls make passengers place their backpacks in from while embarking. Flight crew and seating down passengers are getting constantly hit by straps and bags. Pls
@united Miami Orlando Syracuse Disney World San Francisco Los Angeles
@united Sent my sweet dear super good looking friends at United.
@united ugh how it pains me to write this tweet - my moms bag is missing since her flight landed in MIA at 1pm they don’t know where it is. This is the 10 or more mistake you’ve made with us this year!!!! Help!!!!!!
Not the way i wanted to end 2019... But New Years resolution for 2020: never fly @united again ✈️
@united Japan, 2017. 2nd place was Hong Kong last year. 3rd place are multiple trips with my dad to spring training in FL. 2020 is shaping to be a big one with a trip to Taiwan and Japan for the Olympics!
@united Just hopped off UA1924, one of the attendants with a mild polish accent was absolutely fantastic, gave wings to the children in the row in front of me, helped the mother with her bags. But most of all, he commented on my fantastic tie. First person to do so.Gr8 ppl skills
@united Hi! Well, I need to fly back home THIS YEAR as scheduled, but the pilot didn’t show for the 1565 (supoosed to depart at 6:18 pm) to SJO and now waiting for a new one. I’d appreciate a pilot on time so we can fly on time. Not good news this day and at this hour!!!
Leave it up to @united to lose my bag ON NYE 😖
Me había propuesto, hace 5 años, no volver a volar voluntariamente en @united. De necio, y x usar millas, volví a equivocarme: extrañamente el piloto (un 31/12) no aparece y media hora antes de salir. Esperando que asignen otro y a ver cuándo sale. A ver si llegamos este año!
@united They moved us to American airlines in Dallas tx. 3437
@united In Dallas here. No customer service at E gate and no one telling us what to do. Not cool
@united 2019: 7 long haul international flights, 6 in business class. 70,500+ PQM and $6,900+ PQD. United CC holder and MileagePlus program member since 1992. 2020 Status? None. No flexibility by your team. I’ll be taking my business class travel elsewhere.
@united thank you for having great customer service. 💙💙
Has anyone taken a #UnitedAirlines flight in 2019 that was actually on time? My flight today is being held 30 minutes for people making connections, which will cause the rest of the plane to miss their connections. Great job @united!
Yo @united I’m kind of broke, and am flying basic economy to Denver this weekend. Can you upgrade me to first class? Need my knees ready for the slopes. This leg room is important
@united The reason I was interested is that my daughter flew into SFO just now from DUB en route to YVR flying out on UA 460 and I was following her flight.. And saw the diversion..
@united Told them about the gum and received a single alcohol wipe, which the gum laughed at. Have not mentioned the general dirtiness.
@united you are the toilet water of all airlines
@united I have to give serious kudos to Latoya on UA555 from SAN to ORD today. She was THE BEST! Can you please make sure she is recognized and awarded for her outstanding service??
@united what a complete joke! My kid checked a bag at 11:00 am and the flight was delayed 3 hours. How on God’s green earth is his bag still at the originating airport.
@united De mi vuelo a Newark a la Ciudad de México no llegó mi maleta, amablemente me la enviarán mañana a casa pero ya me quedé sin el outfit que usaría en #AnoNuevo2020
@united yep i’m signed up with alerts cause u get the alerts when i book and when to check in, have gotten flight change texts before
@united just spent 20m removing a massive amount of gum from all over my seatbelt. In general this plane is pretty dirty. Everything feels sticky like when your shoes stick to the floor at the movies.
@united there was no confusion. You just didn’t contact me.
@united you did it with my first flight, too. Left an hour early. Didn’t know until driving to the airport.
@united UA2199.... first you told us it was delayed 30 min due to ground stops in Newark. We all get on the 767. Then you text us it will be another 30 min... then another. Then the pilot tells us that he was not told the mechanics were working on the plane....
hey @united , thanks for not notifying me that my flight for tomorrow, that i couldn’t check in for until 24 hours in advance, is leaving TWO HOURS EARLIER than I expected it to. Not an email, not a text, nothing. Thanks so much! Now i have to figure out transportation :-)
@united Well, I was surprised by the charges but then equally surprised by the nice gesture you just extended to me. Thank you. I’m pretty loyal to United. Have been for years. But even the best airlines can get better. Happy New Year!
@united EPILOGUE: As it turns out, I'm NOT a dummy who can't read ticket times. As originally thought, I only have 15 minutes for my transfer (sorry, TP, your hour+ estimation was wrong). Thankfully, an FA on this flight is also on my next flight and she says I should be okay.
@united I’d like first class for my rebooked flight tomorrow.
@united really plane comes in empty for the already delayed 592 flight to LAX and it still takes tou 20 minutes to start boarding?
@united I tried rebooking and the customer service was the absolute worst. Do better.
@united Thanks for responding... Happy New Year.. 🎉
@united I wish! It's my dream to cross the Panama Canal❤
So grateful for @united agent Teri at D15 service desk at IAD at 2pm today who was equal parts empathetic to my 24 hours of delays and equally take charge to throw me in a cab to BWI to finally get me home to YUL. You are an angel. Happiest of New Years to you. ❤️
@united I'm not, any other airline would have updated the flight status when they found out. I wont be flying United again. More than a hotel voucher and $10 meal voucher would be pretty nice to cover this mess
@united yall needa find some nicer flight attendants lmao just sayin 🙂
Thank you @united from UA2006 8D,E,L,K! Happy New Year!
@united That’s your solution!? Horrible service.
@united That was a 55 min wait and then they disconnected me!! And I only need them changed if they can’t be delivered in the near term.
@united Bruh why not just put my bags on the right plane?? Is it hard to do?
@united After an hour wait for agent we got disconnected. We are only at the location for the bags to be delivered for a limited time and then go back to SFO for fights in the morning. I either want the bags ASAP, stored for pickup at SFO or sent to the destinations of the two folks.
you can literally WALK to your destination &amp; get there faster than with @united
@united Me too! I could have caught a flight from Raleigh since the plane was coming from Texas and has HOURS of notice! Very poor customer service.
@united I accidentally left a book behind on my flight from Cleveland to Denver this morning. Anyway, we can coordinate that coming back to me? The book was Becoming by Michelle Obama.
@united what the fuck? Why are my bags in Denver? When I’m in fuckin Canada?
@united Well unfortunately I’m going to have to because my new flight takes off 3 hours later than the one I booked and I won’t get back home until after midnight!
@united My trip to McMurdo base in Antarctica via Christchurch via LAX via Houston via Lafayette
Missing our NYE party thanks to @united. Disappointed but not surprised.
So if you don't show up for your intial flight @united cancels your entire round-trip ticket and doesn't refund your money. You have to then request a refund! What kind of policy is that? I drove down w/ family &amp; still need my ticket back. Now I have to book another flight.
@united 6 hours of travel from So. Cal to Nor Cal - with 4 hours sitting on planes at gates and only 2 hours actually in the air, damaged bags, and no apologies...not even a free drink. Is that really the best you can do? 🤷🏻‍♀️ #DoBetter
@united canceled two flights, poor accommodations and service. Three bags in the ether for over 24 hours and your bag service website does recognize the service number and now on hold for 39:37 min. Horrendous!
Without me. My body is exhausted and I’m extremely stressed out. This is so unhealthy especially as a heart transplant patient. I have to be in Paris for school on January 2nd. And now I won’t make it in time. @united
Very upset with @united I had a flight to Paris thru Washington at 2:55. Got held up in US customs &amp; got to the gates 15 mins before departure (after overexerting my body to run there). I was told to sit &amp; wait. The employees came back 10 minutes later and told me the flight left
@united Thank you very much. Nice to get a comment from you. Happy New Year
@united cancellation on direct was rebooked overnight and three stops. Second leg of that was delayed because the crew did not show up. Rebooked on then direct. Three bags lost 24 hours ago. Bag check website is not working. No bags. On hold now for 33:01min. No excuse!
Update the first flight was so delayed they rebooked me before we even landed, thx @united, I did want to spend New Year’s Eve in the airport!!
@united are you just gonna keep pushing the flight back because there arent enough people for the flight and you're too cheap to fly us
@united Boarded UA727 over an 80 mins ago and still waiting on paperwork for departure. Why did we board the plane?
@united very upset with your handling of my Jan, 6th international flight. You bounced me from my flight not once but twice. The week before departure. Both times without notification. Spent 6+ hours dealing with customer service. Now you're asking for $ to rebook your mistake.
@united I feel real bad for people with medical conditions waiting SEVEN hours for a flight
@united O'Hare to New York on a 777 with Tuskegee NEXT!!
@united failed to find a crew for my flight so my plane is still in Houston instead of Charlotte. I was supposed to take off 30 minutes ago. Now I will be missing my connecting flight in Denver and will be stuck in the airport once again. Happy New Year's:)
@united $75 offer is not enough. This maze I have to go through to ask for help and compensation is not customer friendly and it was your engine thruster problem that made us turn around and land the plane...WKX06049
And to @united I would like to congratulate you on inspiring a last minute addition to my 2020 resolutions: never fly with your airline again! The amount of cock ups I’ve dealt with because of your ineptitude and shitty customer service surely deserves recognition. Bravo! 🍾🎉🥂
This is the 4th time @united had delayed our flight today. From 235 to now 730 with no explanation
@united can you please respond to my DM?
shoutout to RA @united for figuring it out FAST. great customer service 🙌🏼
@united United Airlines lost my luggage and did absolutely nothing to remedy the problem.
@united Kudos for also showing the old television comedies too - The Office, Friends, and How I Met Your Mother. Makes the flight time go by so much faster!
@united Are you fucking kidding me? Just fix your website. My confirmation number doesn’t matter.
@united help please. United is handing our missing bags and we have no info on where one bag is. We keep receiving conflicting info. Need the bag in the newer few hours due to NYE.
@united for whatever reason, Security at Terminal C in Newark was a breeze today. But if it’s from any improvements you guys made, I applaud y’all. Great improvements around the terminal
@united Worst trip? This one...luggage sitting at EWR for 43 hrs, yet can’t make a flight to CLT. Called cust service 5 times &amp; spent total of 2hr18 min on phone...no update. Gold + CC holder-happy new year to me &amp; 5 friends here-all with status/cc but reconsidering
@united my little brother is traveling today and is on a tight schedule. Why do you require basic economy to check in at the airport? He has a small backpack. Are you planning on charging him for his small backpack? He just wants to print his boarding pass at home.
@united The picture was in Granada, but I landed in Madrid.
@united Hey United. Perhaps instead of worrying about inflight movies, you should focus on better customer service. Friend Meredith flew through Newark on way to CLT Sunday night. Bag still in Newark after multiple calls to customer service and at least 8 flights between the 2 cities.
@united I don’t have a favorite, I absolutely love to travel and explore.
@united it is new year’s eve and all my clothes and makeup that i need are in my bags. HELP ME
@united Certainly not my friend Meredith's current trip to Charlotte for NYE! Her luggage misconnected in EWR and its been 36 hours and no bag Despite the fact there's been 10 flights w/in last 36 hours and an agent identified the contents of her bag. Poor customer svc United!!
@united still hasn’t given me my tracking information. how hard is it to get bags from san francisco to santa barbara????
@united really disappointed with United Airlines, applied for United MileagePlus credit card and was told we can get our seating assignment assigned now I am being told I have to wait 24 hours prior to the flight. Ridiculous customer service.
@united you are always delayed and I hate flying with you guys. #NYE ruined!
.@united I’d Premier Gold but haven’t been added to the Comp. Premier Upgrade list for my upcoming flight tonight. Same thing happened last week. Premier Desk, MileagePlus, and Reservations line all have been unable to help. Any idea who I can contact? Seems to be a glitch.
@united We did. Luckily, our New Year’s Eve party isn’t a dress up party! We’ll be all right, but thanks for responding.
@united why is your lost and found customer service so unhelpful? My lost item was FOUND by the pilot and who tried to get it back to me but now it's lost in your convoluted system. Disappointed and not flying with you again.
@united Flying on flight 1350 yesterday when the fight broke out. Then being jacked around for flight 2257 from terminal E to C which is a very long walk when you have COPD.
@united any update on UA2219? We keep being told 15 min 15 min 15 min, now we are all forced to deplane
@united Thank you😁. Everything, just everything, but I think the view from the Rockefeller center was the highlight of the trip. And btw...my flight back to Halifax with you guys was great too😉👍
@united Any trip that I go home on... Always.
@united Turns out I need more patience. Y’all left my bag in Chicago.
@united now my inbound plane is delayed. this is ridiculous and i will not fly with y’all again
@united flight from #pvr runs out of champagne before noon. On New Years Eve. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Happy new year, suckers! 🎉 🥂 #onejob
@united i fly regularly on your airline with a pet and didn't see any notice of a policy change until after i got to the airport. a simple email heads up before i flew, since you knew i had a pet coming, would have been useful.
@united no thanks. i live in miami
@united The one where you didn't keep passengers hostage for 5 hours. You are criminally incompetent.
@united I left an item on one of your flights on 12/21. A gate agent called me the night it was lost and said they had my item, which has now apparently vanished. Is there anyone who can help me? I've been going through official channels for 10 days.
Leave it to @united to give us a 2 hour delay. I feel like everytime either I or someone I know takes this airline, they can never do their jobs and be on time
I also recieved an email from @united that my flight would have direct TV and wifi....... surprise..... it doesn't! Needless to say I may need to look for another airline for first choice of travel because between this trip and my trip to Hawaii..... color me unimpressed.
MIL, a senior citizen travelled on UA48 from EWR - MUM. Whole experience was very dissatisfying right from Check-in to Inflight experience. Check-in process was chaotic with no one to help her. Then Inflight she was informed that they ran out of food #PatheticService @united
@united Since we all have same last name, clearly no attempt was made
Apparently when you fly first class with @united you no longer get an alcohol beverage while the boarding process is going on..... I thought on my previous flight it was a mistake but this flight I asked when boarding andddd apparently they don't do that anymore.....wtaf
@united and there are no other flights out to miami
@united sucks. My flights back to see family were plagued with delays, and now my flight back to DC has resulted in so many delays that I’m stuck away from home for an extra day.
@united Hello. I flew on the 29th on a trip to get to my 100k miles for 2019. 2 out of the 3 legs posted my MileagePlus miles, but the first leg hasn't and now accruals will not be updated until the MP update is done on the 3rd. Will I still get it?
@united Certainly not this one. Flight 1117 IAH to LAX Delays due to no flight crew and then mechanical issues? Now we sit while you find a part and fix the plane. Not feeling confident about this flight at all! I think we should ALL be issued vouchers or refunded some $$ for this!
@united Can I have a free lounge pass for sending that sir
@united lies to its customers! 2 days of our #honeymoon have been ruined chasing down our property. They #dontcareabouttheircustomers enough to deliver our #luggage to us after their #employees #mishandled it. #unitedsucks
i swear to fucking fuck if i miss NYE in Miami bc of a delayed flight i’m fighting everyone @united
@united My haïr on my head is cold. I asked the flight attendant if the fan could be turned lower. His response - not right now - really??? Turn the god damn air con fan down.
@united Actually we are always told the computer makes the changes. There is no effort w/ computer to keep families together
This is my 2nd time flying with @united and there's an issue just like the last time! I wasn't even informed about the last minute cancellation! I have no words for this sort of unprofessionalism! I even missed wishing my loved ones for New Year.
@united is the people who send flights out stupid? You have a full flight and you send a smaller plane?! Went want something for your stupidity, proper planning prevents piss poor performance.. you guys are about as good as NFL referees. Just kidding they suck too
@united I sent a message to customer care about baggage damage and trip experience and it’s been the reply threshold and I have not heard anything
@united thanks for not letting me and my pup flybdespite providing the dogs age ahead of time you said no and expect me onNew Years Eve to resolve. #united this is the way abandon passengers with a puppy to figure it out! Train your staff!
@united adds another transit to my existing 27h flight. They cancelled the SFO flight at the last minute. I'm stranded here. PLEASE HELP
@united São Paulo, Brazil. Multiple times on United. Unfortunately you’ve raised the IAD-GRU price 😢
@united I loved that trip when the flight was overbooked so you beat up that passenger. I love you service is your passion 🥰
4 out of 5 doctors recommend @united
6 hour delay, no food for 8 hour flight, having to pay 2x for car service for my elderly parents- compensation by @united nada &amp; customer care apparently doesn't speak to people after an hour on the phone they were than just reservations &amp; couldn't help #unitedairlines #theworst
@united hey United thanks for Stranding me on my return flight home with a puppy because you won’t allow it to fly. Despite me providing the age of the dog at the time of booking. Unreal. What am I supposed to do as your airline just washed your hands?
@united I was unable to change my seat online to one more forward; gonna try to do it at the counter. Anything I can do/say to ease the process?
@united Hi, why is UA900 from LHR being diverted to Iqaluit?
@united thanks for losing my bag on New Year’s Eve, not answering the help line AND have the customer service lady at the Monterrey Mex airport have the nastiest attitude
I was supposed to be home in Vancouver at 10pm last night. I have instead been stuck in IAD since 6pm. Current flight has been delayed by 3 hours, and now I've missed my connection again. @united I had to pay for my own hotel last night, can I please have some assistance?
@united Flying to San Francisco with you last March from Heathrow on an early morning flight. You guys saved my holiday.
@united When I flew on your Boeing 757-200 from SFO to LAX and the flight was practically empty. My favourite aircraft and I will be very sad when the 757 is removed from your fleet.
@united dig. I called again and they said they'd put in some kind of request; hopefully something can happen. thanks for trying! happy new year
@united I did. But, could have gone another way on top of your “stellar” service.
@united I called them a few minutes ago and they said there was nothing they could do except that maybe y'all would reach out and offer to let me buy my way up (I'd be happy to!) I'll try ringing again
@united hold my flight in IAH you bastards.
@united Thank you for your speedy response! I bought both flights at the same exact time. DMing now
Why is Reddit still blocked on in-flight WiFi? @united
@united Every 30 minutes the flight keeps getting delayed by another 30 minutes. What’s going on? You have a crew or you don’t?
@united flight is delayed further LAMMEEEEE
@united We got everything sorted about 20 minutes later, thanks.
@united I was diagnosed with the flu 2 days ago and am flying tomorrow. Do you let people rebook if they're sick?
@united if i knew you guys werent gonna answer idve just put all my info on here
@united what’s with your awful over the phone customer service? Yelling and cutting people off is acceptable now? Also ... different prices via mobile app and website, what a rip off!
Hey @united, why are you charging me $180 for two checked bags underweight on a domestic flight today? I also just paid $180 for the same bags from MEL - LAX.
El nivel de amargue que tengo no es normal gracias @united tienen el peor servicio del mundo en aerolíneas y además engañan a sus clientes me dañaron el fin de año .Gracias totales .
Last passenger and checked back put on my flight! We made it, thanks @united
@united Seems like you just did a bad job scheduling and dont want to pay for more pilots and crew and instead are pushing it back
@united hey there - I’m unable to check in to my flight from EWR to CAK tomorrow morning. What’s going on?
@united happy new year for 2020 #Safeflying
@united never flying with y’all again, turned my 20 hour flight into a 30 hour ordeal and I get food vouchers 🙃
I was initially told when I filed the Delayed Baggage report that the garment bag was still at ORD, but no one @united seems to be taking any action to locate it. I can replace the clothes, but things like my Green Beret have sentimental value and aren’t as easily replaced.
I am going to have to travel to an Army post, hope that they have everything in stock that I need, and buy my uniforms, all my patches, etc, and then take the uniforms to a tailor. Can someone @united please get involved with this?
I was told that the bag was in ORD and would be delivered the next day. I then filed a Delayed Baggage Report after waiting an additional 7 days. Since then I have spoken with @united at 800-355-2247 several times but they have been of little help.
I returned on December 21, 2019 from a year long deployment on @united, processed customs at ORD, and then checked them on UA 0597 to BWI. When I arrived at BWI, a bag was missing.
@united Hi... my mother is back on the plane and they are saying another 3 hour delay... when can she be put on another flight out? The same flight number with departure date of 12/31/19 is still showing on time... how does she get on that flight?
hey @united, you need to do a MUCH better job of informing passengers about your new in-cabin pet paperwork requirement. this is not the kind of thing you want people to discover while they're checking in.
@united on board flight UA2150 from Honolulu to Denver which landed 30 mins back (31st Dec) and still waiting for a gate. Isn’t this your hub?? Utterly ridiculous that now most connecting passengers will have to rush to connection or will miss it!! Denver is your hub!!
@united I keep getting an error when trying to check-in to my flight. Is this not working?
Not really sure why I continue to fly @united oh right it’s because I continue to mistakenly think that being a #MillionMiler counts for something
I had one of the worst experiences on my flight. Was extremely delayed due to unmaintained bathrooms, had to deplane, and to top it off I lost my brand new earbuds in the move over. Have flown with you a lot, but would hate for this experience to make me have to switch. @united
Am I allowed to be annoyed my @united flight is delayed by two hours due to "crew rest" what's that mean??? Someone call out? Bad scheduling?
Hey, great maintenance program @united #UA515 further delayed after 14 _HOURS_ which thanks to your crappy scheduling has also delayed my family’s flight #UA291. Scamming people by not canceling means rebooking would CO$T A BUNCH
@united 20 minutes later, no mechanic even on the wing to change the lights. Very poor plane quality checks.
@united you shouldn’t schedule tight connections in different terminals. You’re the only airline I’ve flown that does that... why can’t you be helpful?!?!
This morning in Madison, WI there was only one person checking bags and IDs for two very full flights to Chicago and Denver resulting in a huge line. In total 73 people were told they missed their checkin window and would need to be rebooked on other flights. @united
@united I just sent you a message with all the info we currently have.
@united It’s only 60 degrees outside. The air con needs to blast on my flight why???
My @united flight lands in Houston 15 minutes before my connection to SFO boards. I am in the very last row of a full plane. This is gonna be fun.
@united Hey there’s were all good, just waiting for ATC. Now if you can get a rum and coke delivered I’d take it. lol.
@united Thanks to PBI Baggage service first helping to arrange the delivery of my delayed luggage from UA 1197
Hi @united I’d really appreciate it if you could get me back to DC tonight so that I can put on my velvet jumpsuit and shiny mask and silly glasses and ring in 2020 with my friends instead of alone in a hotel room in Chicago!!
So @united provides roasted potatoes,eggplant and Zuccini with bread 🥖 as breakfast 🤦🏻‍♂️... CDG &gt; EWR (requested special Asian Veg. Meal). Asians don’t eat roasted veggies &amp; breakfast 🍳....
Getting an extra hour of seat time on the @united flight today waiting at the gate for the pilot. Kinda need the pilot. At least they’re comfy seats. A rum and coke would be nice about now.
so i had the most terrible experience with @united in august and they gave me a $100 coupon i tried to use it and it didnt even work contacted them via email and no one has answered talked to a representative at the airport who told me he couldnt do anything nor give me an
@united You can release the 4 Monahan seats on flight UA5566 for tomorrow 1/1 ORD to SAT
@united God Bless! We made it!
@united Dumb vs delusional. A toss-up.
@united The agent showed a complete lack of urgency or empathy and did nothing to help any of these people make their flights. United was unable to rebook us on any other flights today. This is completely unacceptable. I will never fly United ever again.
Flight slightly delayed due to late arriving crew, so we got some snacks! Thanks, @united!!!
@united thanks for making me miss my flight and fucking up my New Years :)
@united we are scheduled on flight 1269 today. It's running late due to your planes never being properly maintained. When we miss our cx at iah, when will the next flight to elp with 3 available seats be?
@united you have bitterly disappointed us, pathetic ground service, horrible... delayed flights... no professionalism absolutely.
@united Thanks for the quick replies.
@united Yeah, I'll send you a DM w/ the details and ref #, but I can't say that this feels like it will lead to anything productive. Could you answer my question about your beverage policy though? I think people would appreciate clarification.
@united Excellent Service this morning for UA 1197! Gate 70 agents were great! Pilots &amp; Flight attendants fabulous! Thank you to all! Happy New Year
@united Please don’t remove in seat TVs! One of the attendants told us you were on new planes and that’s frustrating! Parents with kids need those 🤣
@united Anyway, maybe you could at least publicly clarify what your policy is on serving alcoholic beverages on planes? What, exactly, are the rules provided to employees?
@united Your customer service representatives at Chicago OHare were the ones who gave us that excellent advice.
Hey @united I just booked a basic economy flight with my MP Explorer card, so I can bring a carryon. Will I be able to get my boarding pass before arriving at the airport since the restriction on BE is for verifying personal item size?
@united Getting ready to land. Please call and hold gate C8 — according to FA you have 93 passengers with super close connections— flight4574 ORD
@united I dunno you, social media person, and this obviously is not your fault, but come on, lol. It doesn't take 7 days to figure out what went wrong here and you definitely never suggested that time frame at any point before now.
@united Then why would you say differently both at the gate and when I initially called the # provided to me? Sounds like you're just trying to pass this off and ignore it, tbh.
@united but i was told that you would get back to me before now and it's honestly a little concerning that you haven't considering that i would call this a serious issue that jeopardizes the safety of your passengers! i don't want free stuff btw just knock this crap off
@united anyway i talked to the customer service lady at o'hare who was very helpful and kind at a moment where i was very rattled and coming off a panic attack and if there is a record of that conversation you should give her a raise
@united oh and the flight attendant gave me some bullshit apology when i was getting off the plane so they knew they were doing the wrong thing and were just too cowardly to do anything about it in the moment so fuck that also
@united do you not get cut off on planes? i've gotten cut off for less at actual bars! and those bartenders were absolutely correct!
hey @united i tried not to be the social media person but i emailed y'all to complain about your flight attendant serving the guy next to me literally 10 shots of vodka and ignoring him bugging me for my entire flight on friday and still haven't heard a thing so what's up????
@united thanks for your concern over customers safety. I called this morning 2 change a flight for safety reason with #wsHenry The road 55 in the advisory for unsafe conditions is our only way 2 the airport for my sons flight. You still charged a change fee #customersdontmatter
It's ridiculous that airlines that have taken away the old free check-in suitcase now beg to check-in hand-luggage before boarding in the gates... @united
@united Why is the flight UA6239 from YOW to IAD delayed by 5 hours? No information is provided online or at the airport.
@united Thank you to you and your staff during my recent family visit to the US. Last minute Business Upgrade (my first time) and despite a couple of flight delays, due to weather, your team were incredibly helpful and patient. Happy New Year!
@united Just spoke to my mom and she said no one was on the plane when it pushed back from the gate...
@united I can see where this can happen for connecting passengers as bags get out of order. Direct flights have no excuse. An operations specialist should focus on this issue.
@united you SUCK! United Airlines is - be FAR - the WORST thing to happen to commercial air travel in its entire history. The way you treat your Passengers is CRIMINAL! And the worst part is that every BONEHEAD ABUSIVE Decision You make is instantly followed by 10 other airlines.
@united Thanks... yeah the app is saying it will arrive in like 15 minutes which is totally not accurate so I just want to make sure when she lands I’ll be at EWR waiting for her as she really could have driven from Portland to Newark like 3 times at this point 🥴
@united It’s my mother, she is 71 and doesn’t even know what Twitter is... also not great with a cell phone.. so I am trying to keep up with her flight the best I can... the app is now saying the plane departed but it did that last night and it never left!
@united you moved my husband and I seats out of extra legroom due to an aircraft change and sat us in two seats apart from each other with no resolution. How will you be fixing this? Sent a DM and would like to hear back
Just had a great customer service experience with @united adjusting seats on my booking. Happy New Year!
shoutout to the @united flight attendant who gave me water and made sure i was ok before sitting down though. i love her
God I hate airlines, even though I need them. My @united flight should have left at 8am, now it's gonna be 10am. Now I'm sccccrewed with my connections and I'll be missing my NYE party....
@united Mechanical issue delayed flight (for 24 hours!) to go home to see my brother before he passed away. No other alternative flights. By the time I got to the airport the next morning, he had died in the early hours. I never got to say goodbye #FlightDelayHorrorStories
@united How many planes are painted this way?! At which airports can it/they be found?!😍🤓👀
@united how are you going to board a flight to Denver knowing a panel is damage. Then deplane the aircraft and now its 2 hours late
@united the service on flight 252 on December 30th was amazing! From the personalized welcome speech to first class passengers from the captain, to the amazing service from every flight attendant. Bravo!
@united Now to add further a flat tire 😭. Very impressed by your speedy response to your customers even when we are just complaining 👍🏻
Fun fact the shortest flight in the @united network goes from IAH to College Station! #GigEm #Whoop !
@united I’m sure you can’t, but I am the premier member on mine and my husbands reservation, yet he is ahead of me on upgrades and I was dropped to the bottom this morning and he isn’t even the premier member. Going on our honeymoon and we won’t even be able to sit by each other.
Hey @united is it possible to merge 2 itineraries? We booked identical award itineraries through our respective MileagePlus accounts. Now we have a 3hr time change on one leg and want to move to another flight. Would be nice to only worry about 1 confirmation number.
@united It’s all good! I get some of my best sleep on flights! No phones ringing or email pinging!
Hey @united your crew on 1612 IND-DEN was super nice and friendly for such an early flight. ❤️ #CustomerService #UnitedAirlines
@united Happy almost 2020! 9 friends are flying to Australia in April and hoping to see the prices go down. Any tips on the best time to book? We have flights picked and are ready to book!
@united I have only seen 3 of them! Oops! I usually binge watch sitcoms or sleep! Happy New Year United!
hello @united we had an ole fashioned “hard boot” situation where we gave the plane the old turn off and then turn on. Seems to be fine. People are mad though but I am the peacekeeper. We can’t lose eachother here. We need to stay together.
My flight is returning to the gate bc a tray table will not stay in its full upright and locked position. Is this real life? Get some #ducttape or rub some #Tussin on it @united
I still can’t believe it’s been 3 days and @united did not find my bag from a domestic direct 3 hour flight.
Seriously @united! Our plane has to to go back to the gate because a tray table is down after the attendance already secured it? THIS IS NOT OK. It’s up. Let’s get a move on. Absolute worst airline.
Yesterday: IND ➡️ IAD - 95,212 miles IAD ➡️ LAX - 97,500 miles Today: LAX ➡️ IAD - 99,788 miles IAD ➡️ SAV - 100,312 miles and 1K status! @united #milagerun
@united please hold flight 4574 ORD to SAT lots of people coming from PHL 2409 gonna miss that flight — no more flights to SATtoday. Let’s start 2020 off right and get us home!👌🏻
. @united your entire staff at Heathrow is amazing and in particular the staff of the United Club and Sally in Global Services went the extra mile(s) for us as we return from DUB. Don't change a thing about LHR other than more flights from LAX. TY Sally!
@united least that I expect is a courteous staff, but just horrible behavior.
Very disappointed with @united reservations. I originally booked a round trip. However, I couldn't take the outgoing flight. United automatically canceled my return flight reservation. Now I am stuck on my holiday spot!
@united congrats. Morning of our flight and the flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok was cancelled again and we are being told to figure it out in Hong Kong.
IDGAF about how dramatic I was at the airport and how many people I cried in front of. @united lied about the reason my flight was late that caused me to miss my connection and tried to not give me a room because of the lie but some how put my luggage on the flight but not me.
@united I filled it out four days ago.
@united And no one seems to know anything with any consistency. The sign says delayed to 3:10pm (22 hours late, if you’re counting), the app says on time, one gate agent says 11am.
@united Yes, I filled it out but only get an automated reply.
@united I recently lost my wallet on a United flight and have been trying to reach a live person to no avail. What's the best way to recover items left on a plane?
Hey @united it would be great if you all implemented a first of its kind, #premium pet service that solved the questionable service animal accommodations that are so apparent to nearly everyone who flies. Hit me up. As a #1k I’ve got some ideas. #customersatisfaction
.@united I won't tell you how we got through baggage drop but I believe in God now. Thousands of people left behind. Never forget them. Never again.
@united a 6.52 am flight delayed to 7.30 pm. What do I do with my international connections? You surprise me always😎😎😎
En mi experiencia de viaje eviten volar por @united mal servicio, aviones de segunda baños super sucios y no hacer conexión en EU, sus filtros se seguridad hacen que casi pierda el vuelo, son tan exagerados! si tuvieran uno bien realizado bastaría! #viajes
@united you always surprise me. 😎😎😎😎
@united Don’t be sorry, be better. The 7am is now further delayed.
@united Any plans on extending this route? Needing to get to cape town in October 2020
@united Can’t book a case on flight to NYC Newark on the app from uk customer service says pay 60usd at Manchester airport on check in is this correct?
@united Doesn’t work on the app or online
@united Baggage belt not moving. No room to move.
@united Happy New Year’s Eve! There is a birthday boy aboard Flight 554, Houston to Denver, this morning! Anyway the crew can give him a shout-out? I’m not there to do it myself. Thanks, his mom :)
@united This has been the worst customer service I have ever received. And no one in the company has actually done anything besides apologize for the misinformation, but then provide me with MORE misinformation.
@united Your staff has been telling us it would be delivered tonight and so has all the tracking information that was given to me. I think you need to get your information straight because today has been one lie after another.
@united It has yet to arrive even though it landed at 5:50pm, we were told it’d be back to us tonight, and it says it had been picked up at 10:11pm.
@united Glad to get the same standard message you text everyone, excited to miss my layover on a holiday! 😊👍🏽
I can guarantee you, there will never NOT be a problem w/ @united , choose anywhere else
@united Ha! Bohemian rhapsody and Aladdin, both on United flights! Happy 2020 guys!!
@united After waiting 25 minutes you assholes hung up on me.
A week today, I will be on @united flying between LHR and EWR. A well trodden route for me in recent years...
@united why am I waiting 25 minutes to cancel a reservation and why doesn’t your website work? You fucking suck!
Hey...@united I private messaged you, can you help me out
@united your workers are being rude to other passengers. Just letting you know 😊
@united How much would an upgrade to first class be? Hit my DM’s up please
@united flying from Edinburgh to Newark. You boys got wifi on board?
@united No. I went over to the gigantic bag lines instead. Some girl came back and said it's not manned until 5am?
@united There are basic economy check-in kiosks in Terminal C. There's nobody over there to check in bagless customers.
@united On UA49 BOM-EWR Polaris business right now. Most terrible service and jaded flt attendants on 16 hr flight. Got 1 meal at start and with 2 hrs left, still waiting for breakfast. That's it! Instead of complaining about Emirates, UA should learn hospitality from them.
Good morning @united ... Why is there no United staff at the basic economy check-in? #EWR
@united #united united airlines #CustomerService sucks .. don’t fly them
I dig how @united communicates via text to ensure you know when it's time to leave for the airport, check in, board etc. But now I feel like I should get a text when it's time to do everything now, like you know go pee and call home to mom #schedulemylife
@united hey booked flights from Dublin to New York but on my booking reservation it has put my firist name and middle name together. They are separate on my passport is this ok ?
Thanks @united for losing my bag and having me wait up for it to be delivered sometime between 9:30pm and 3:30am. I definitely wanted to stay up all night after traveling today..
@united If the entertainment system actually worked ....
@united #unitedairlines #united we spend thousands of dollars for first class tickets for a 10 plus hour INTERNATIONAL flight and my husband and I have no working TV. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS - we have 1 working laptop -doesnt work for these pod seats. How do you plan to rectify?
Travel peeps: I have a 90-minute layover at LHR and have to get my boarding pass in the process because @united won’t let me check in for an itinerary with a leg on Turkish, and Turkish can’t print a UA boarding pass. Where do I go to get this?
Thanks @united for a 4 hours delay with no notice to finish off my vacation right... I hope you're planning to do something about it
@united I was vouchered a hotel room but hotel (30 min from airport) wont have shuttles because new yr eve. Will united reimburse my taxi?
@united I figured this was pointless, but worth a try. It apparently was
@united She is busy trying to get back to base and does not have time to deal with this. It's disgraceful to have a 14+ hour delay. You can deal with me if you have questions. You broke a contract she had with you and 2 flights a day is ridiculous
@united My daughter doesn't have time to deal with this. If you have questions or care about this, you can talk to me. I have all the details and her authorization toi take care of this on her behalf
I've arrived well at MUC and I'm very happy with @united and their service
@united That really helps those waiting in the airport.
Me and my wife have a work day tomorrow and our day ia severely impacted due to this delay. This leaves us with no options. I am status holder on a different airline and this is not the kind of service i have experienced!! I need @united to offer me a free flight change
#HappyNewYear to everyone except @united who just canceled my flight
@united - Me and my wife are mileage plus members trying to fly home to EWR from SFO (DS05G8). The flight has been delayed for close to 1.5 hrs - yet the app is not offering me change in flight. The person at the kiosk is not even able to confirm if the flight is even leaving.
@united Yes I was except they were some of the very last out. There's no point in putting on the Priority tags if they are just gonna be ignored. I'm already 3 and a half hours late and to add insult to injury, my bags come out pretty much last (after the non priority bags).
