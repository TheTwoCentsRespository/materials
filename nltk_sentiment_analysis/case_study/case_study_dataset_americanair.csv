@AmericanAir Flight delayed three hours in Montreal, therefore missing connection in Philadelphia &amp; gf + I have to spend the night in PHL airport (&amp; miss work) - a ‚Äúweather delay,‚Äù but nice weather in both cities. Thanks for the anniversary present! (He said; sarcastically.)
@AmericanAir today you proved to be the worst airline period!!!
@AmericanAir still sitting on the runway. When did you become Spirit?
So now, not only do I have to find my way to the city I was supposed to be in 5 hours ago. I‚Äôve gotta retrieve my bag once I finally get there. Bang up job @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir the amount of people waiting at customer service here in DFW because they had to run to their gate only to see the door being shut as they approached is ridiculous. Y'all suck so bad. I guess this is how you get basically a monopoly
@AmericanAir I travelled on flight AA1415 from YVR to DFW. My luggage has not arrived in DFW. I have a connecting flight to LHR and then AMS. Your app suggests it was not loaded onto my YVR - DFW flight. Please advise. I live in Amsterdam, not London.
Hey @AmericanAir , I need help with a booking I made on the AA website. Haven't received the receipt or confirmed ticket yet. Appreciate it if i could talk to a real human about this.
@AmericanAir you have definitely lost our mobility scooter.
@AmericanAir Thanks. Not the best. Still awaiting the update notification text.
@AmericanAir You seem like you don‚Äôt care that you screwed us over. You canceled our flight 3 weeks ago and didn‚Äôt tell us it was canceled. Then you want to charge an exhorbitant sum for a new flight because you can. Least you should do is send a cancellation notice.
Hey @AmericanAir instead of letting miles get forfeited, maybe allow me to designate a charity in advance so that miles get used for good instead of forfeited.
@AmericanAir terrible experience flying from Miami to Cincinnati. 3 hours late leaving and the grounds crew isn't ready for us to pull in. I guess the extra 2 hours to prep wasn't enough. Not a fan!!!
@AmericanAir Filed a claim immediately afterwards and still no bag so far. I don't understand how a bag just disappears. Been a loyal customer over the years. Very disappointing!
@AmericanAir We have been waiting at the gate 20 minutes for my wife's mobility scooter. You seem to have lost it.
First, our flight is delayed 6+ hours because the crew that was supposed to be on my flight from Charlotte to Miami is rerouted to another flight. Now our flight is delayed again because we do not have a pilot. Come on @AmericanAir you have to do better! This is ridiculous!
@AmericanAir One more night in a very good hotel is nice (thanks for the accommodation) but was totally not our plan! Supposed to be home tonight! Family&amp;friends,stay tuned! we were told pick up at the hotel at 6:45am, flight to Charlotte at 10am, one stop at Dallas!, and finally SFO ~7:30pm!
Hey @AmericanAir Flight 4115 to TLH is delayed 30 minutes and will now arrive 4 minutes after midnight, my son‚Äôs bday!! He‚Äôs heading back to FSU. Can #AAteam please wish my son a happy bday near arrival time? ü•≥ TIA
@AmericanAir Reassuring... What can you do now, proactively, on the missing bag?
@AmericanAir im home, it‚Äôs all good. thank you for not pulling the rug out from under me, it‚Äôs been a long trip.
@AmericanAir crew announces pilot is missing. What the hell is this??? You‚Äôve shuffled people from an oversold flight to a pilotless flight?? #criminals
My first time flying first class with @AmericanAir and it was a excellent experience.
@AmericanAir deserves major kudos: 1. Moving active duty soldiers to available first class seats. 2. Waiving fees to change flights due to a death in the family. Thanks, AA
@AmericanAir flight delayed for six hours because of lack of crew??? Clearly you oversold our flight and moved us to a different plane. You‚Äôre not worth it. #airport #AA85 #fail #thiefs
@AmericanAir IS AWFUL. NEVER EVER again!
@AmericanAir how early do I need to check in for a flight from CLT to MBJ
Strong start to a national tour: @AmericanAir forced me to check my carry-on *while onboard* but never gave me a tag. now I have to buy a whole new wardrobe and a suitcase. success!
NEVER fly @AmericanAir !!! Absolutely horrifying. HORRIBLE service, constant delay and mismanagement. I‚Äôm DISGUSTED that I spent my money on a first class ticket to be incredibly inconvenienced and disrespected. FED UP!!!!
Why doesn't @AmericanAir allow its customers to reserve a vegetarian or other special dietary meal online for international flights like EVERY OTHER AIRLINE? Why not make things easier for your customers?
@AmericanAir what‚Äôs always late and never helps? You!
@AmericanAir just want to give a shout out to Shea in Charlotte. Good customer service. Thanks for treating me and my son like human beings.
@AmericanAir #AATeam AA 1506 was to depart Miami for Newark Jan 4, 1.20pm but was late 4h on a 2.5h flight.Incoming plane was under maintainence. Replacing plane was under maintainance with us on board.Pilot‚Äôs shift expired so we waited for new crew. Had to run to connection.Bad!
@AmericanAir dicks around all day delaying, changing, delaying, and finally canceling my kid‚Äôs first flight alone. Stuck in Chicago and gets on a flight to an airport and 1.5hrs from original destination. We were told delay was for maintenance....
@AmericanAir it has been over 2 hours and I‚Äôm still waiting for a response.
@AmericanAir 615-480-5953 I‚Äôve spoken w specialists already. They all say the same thing. Not going through any more hoops. We‚Äôre ready for a simple check to replace my guitar. Let me know when you‚Äôre ready to do that and we can talk further.
@AmericanAir hey hey! The #1 FA on AA 2529 is amazing! Y‚Äôall should clone her!
@AmericanAir Dec 24th 2019 I traveled from Chennai to Dallas on American Airlines,till now i didn‚Äôt get my two check-in bags,all my immigration documents,Clothes and Personal stuff were placed in my two check-in bags.Worst Experience in my life.
@AmericanAir First class came last and and ours was the very last bag delivered. It could not have been worse.
Put @AmericanAir down on the list of airlines I will never use again.
@AmericanAir 3033 just left for ORD from YYZ. 2395 ORD to PHX needs to wait!
Unhappy with @AmericanAir and their service. Please DM me
@AmericanAir is my FAVORITE flying w anyone else makes me wanna yack
@AmericanAir still sitting in the tarmac.....AA1942
@AmericanAir can I use miles to upgrade my seat instead of paying?
@AmericanAir a huge airline w a swelling carbon footprint must stop forcing people into one-use plastics. AA1898 Ignoring my request to fill my bottle w water Kathy hands me a plastic cup, which I dump into my bottle and hand back. ‚ÄúJust wait and throw it in the trash!‚Äù Shocking.
At this point we‚Äôve been waiting for 10 extra minutes. And we still have to make it down the runway. I‚Äôm pissedt. I‚Äôm never flying @AmericanAir EVER. AGAIN.
@AmericanAir Flight AA1942 from Charlotte wants to get to its destination......it's been an hour, we were 1/2 an hour late, now it's an hour.....how much longer?
.@AmericanAir this is the most stressful situation ever. Not only was the gate changes SEVERAL times before takeoff the flight is now delayed. With no notification to the passengers
@AmericanAir I'm sitting on the tarmac on AA1942 &amp; we had a delayed flight already, &amp; then we had to turn back to the gate because "a passenger forgot an important item." This was after a delayed flight from Florence, SC before ...Flight was scheduled for 8:35pm, still on tarmac.
Delightful proactive service from Quadeera on @AmericanAir 4971 after miserable gate service
I checked in 2 hours ago and yet I'm the last person who checked in for an overbooked flight (by 9 people). Is this a joke? @AmericanAir And I'm alone with a dog who has no food for the hotel you're trying to put me in overnight till another flight tomorrow night
Thanks @AmericanAir for leaving my luggage on the tarmac in the rain, now my clothes are wet!
@AmericanAir talk about bad customer service
Just booked my flight from Austin to Harrisburg for RTX with @AmericanAir . I will see you guys in July
@AmericanAir What‚Äôs the latest? AA1859? Website is no help...
@AmericanAir fuck yoy, you dirty little fucks, fuck you. Absolutely fuck you. You're such fucking fucks. Missed my flight, have to wait till tomorrow morning and you dirty little fucks can't even give a voucher for a cheaper hotel room? Fuck u you fucks
@AmericanAir anyway to incorporate a ‚Äúplease use a headset if playing games, listening to music, etc. on your phone‚Äù into your safety videos? It sounds like a casino on ur flights.
@AmericanAir the military are boarding then she proceeds to say oh these ransoms people are blocking you. My wife is a veteran. She isn‚Äôt blocking anyone. Bs.smacking gum while she is at it.
@AmericanAir Yeah thanks but the communication failures were epic for this flight. The ground team needs help in a big way.
Thank you @AmericanAir for making me miss my exams, erasing two of our friends seats from existence even though they have them on their app, and also having the laziest employees i have ever stumbled upon.
@AmericanAir Given American‚Äôs low on-time arrival rate, it did not surprise me the first flight was late. However, not waiting for a customer that is late due to an American flight is extremely poor customer service. It has cost me more than 4+ hours of time worth more than $1,000 of my time!
@AmericanAir not sure how you are still in business with the multiple delays due to signatures missing. Unbelievable. Needless to say never flying AA again.
@AmericanAir your flight attendants need serious customer service training! I am appalled at there horrible attitudes.
Finally taking off, almost hit the 3 hour mark. Thanks @AmericanAir
A companhia a√©rea mais preconceituosa que existe üëâüèΩ @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir never fails to ruin my day
Thanks @AmericanAir for being over an hour delayed and allowing me to wait 45 minutes for my bags in Atlanta!! What does executive platinum mean to you these days??!!
So sick of @AmericanAir. They cost us 12 hours in London with our daughter in April, and now they‚Äôve failed to get our daughter back to London on time.
@AmericanAir Good night! Please check your dm‚Äôs please.
Left my brand new water bottle on my AA1789 flight today. Asked the crew at the gate and they were less than helpful.....plz help? @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir thanks for delaying our flight 5 times. You guys are sick!
@AmericanAir Do you routinely have problems with making connections on time or is it just when connections are in Dallas? Both legs of my family‚Äôs flight from San Antonio to Grand Rapids. Lost bags included!
@AmericanAir Tried multiple times. Ready to talk with someone else now.
Best flight experience I've ever had @AmericanAir .
@AmericanAir and y‚Äôall customer service agents are rude
We had an amazing experience on @AmericanAir flying from LAX to Boston Christmas Eve on a red-eye. The flight attendants were phenomenal. They went above and beyond. We were traveling with our two little kids and they did everything to make it a great flight. #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir how does a flight that is scheduled to leave after your flight end up leaving before when both of them are leaving from Charlotte and arriving in Dayton. #yesbothweredelayed #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir AA please open more flights from PEK &amp; HKG to the US! Kids out of college can't get home for weeks!
@AmericanAir Happy New Year! I was wondering how much is your check-in baggage fee from Canada to California? Thanks!
@AmericanAir your #Phl staff at Gate 14 for flight 1472 to #SFO was so rude for no reason. Even the mananger came over and was equally unprofessional. It was a misunderstanding that they poorly handled. I been a customer to long for that kinda behavior! üò§üò†
Gotta love when I have 0 minutes to make my connection @AmericanAir makes me check my roller bag because there‚Äôs ‚Äúno space‚Äù but someone was allowed to bring her a bad big enough to fit a five year old that had no dream of fitting in the overhead
@AmericanAir I was on flight 1661 from IAH to CLT. There was severe turbulence, drinks spilled everywhere. Nothing was provided to help clean up the mess, but we had time to push your credit card over the intercom. This is not good customer service we expect when flying.
Hey @AmericanAir why does it take 2/12 hrs to get gas and 1 bottle of O2 Wichita mechanic at the grocery store. Now taking another hour to complete log book. What is up with that #needtobebetterprepared
@AmericanAir after nearly a 4 hour delay I am finally boarding my flight. What will #AmericanAirlines do for the huge inconvenience? #delayflight #airport
@AmericanAir Rebooking isn't an issue. Reliability when traveling with an infant is of paramount importance (and unfortunately unmet in this case). Can't change that the next flight was 4 hrs away (5 now due to another delay), but the unexpected $39.50 for dinner is most annoying.
@AmericanAir you guys are truly awful. I need help and information and am getting neither.
@AmericanAir compensation for my whole trip - worst airline ever
@AmericanAir is easily Top 2 worst airlines. And it ain‚Äôt 2. Dead no reason I‚Äôve been in this damn airport since 9am just to be run around the building jumping around flights. Now I‚Äôm not getting home tn and I could‚Äôve been home 3 hours ago. Never again.
@AmericanAir will now miss our connecting flight. Wonderful.
@AmericanAir shedding clothes. It‚Äôs hotter than well you get the idea. It‚Äôs hot. For the love turn on the air.
@AmericanAir Make it make sense. You delay multiple flights then don‚Äôt have any answers as to why and after all that I miss my flight and I have to foot the bill for a ride to Burbank from LAX. Thanks but no thanks.
What a horrible experience flying on @AmericanAir , flight was delayed multiple times and both trips said plane came with seat back seats and neither did. #NeverAgain
I promise you will hear from me @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir still waiting on any type of response. No emails, no voice mail. Nothing.
@AmericanAir update: still sitting. Still sweating. Lots of unhappy people.
@AmericanAir update: still sweating my tits off and still sitting on the runway. #help
@AmericanAir late incoming plane, sitting on plane for over an hour still waiting to take off and no ac. It may be January but it‚Äôs Florida and it‚Äôs hot.
@AmericanAir Yes and now I‚Äôve been waiting an extra 20+ minutes for a SECOND bag ( already got the first) even though both show scanned at baggage claim. You clearly have not staffed this weekend adequately. One person handling 5 carousels
@AmericanAir Customer service from Austin(Austen?) who is apparently the supervisor for terminal D at Dallas is shocking. Made my wife cry while trying to locate her checked bag which had medication in, and refused to give his name to me so I can ensure my complaint gets to you!
I‚Äôm never flying @AmericanAir again! My flight has been canceled, delayed, delayed, delayed, and now delayed again! üôÑ
experienced such incredible customer service w @AmericanAir these past few days, until just arriving at Logan and interacting with most miserable, disrespectful woman üòï what a shame that my trip ended on such a bad note after a great trip!
@AmericanAir started our trip at 3:30am and we are still waiting to get to our destination. Delayed. Diverted. Cancelled. Rented a car. Delayed again. Now crew is late. #overit
@AmericanAir what does it take to get a response from you guys? Still no bag and no update. As a loyal AA flyer, I'm highly disappointed.
@AmericanAir Your early upgrade notification emails always make my day! Thank you for always taking care of your #EP‚Äôs. Y‚Äôall actually make my hectic travel schedule bearable.
@AmericanAir Your lack of replies and help have been the only consistent thing about AA today.
@AmericanAir vivid seats partnership? Awful experience...reckless
Been trying to track down our lost baggage with @AmericanAir that‚Äôs been stuck in Philly for days but no one in Philadelphia Airport is responding. Happy new year! üôÉ
I just wanna know why @AmericanAir keeps delaying my damn flight!!! üò°üò°
@AmericanAir currently 26 hours delayed, can you take me home yet or have you got another maintence issue or no pilot??!!
@AmericanAir Well, my daughter landed and you guys never reached out. Thanks a lot
@AmericanAir Flight just got delayed until tomorrow. Any info?
@AmericanAir Flown American almost every time I travel and the one issue just turns into more. Absolutely crazy
@AmericanAir Arrived around 4 for my ‚Äú6pm flight‚Äù the service member scheduled me for, turned out I missed another flight that was supposed to be at 2:32pm. Got another flight rescheduled, but no help on trying to even upgrade my seat for all the hassle I‚Äôve been put through lol.. what a joke
@AmericanAir just wanted to say I‚Äôll never fly your airline ever again. I‚Äôd rather walk than fly your unfriendly shit bus in the sky. You are the devil!
@AmericanAir this seems to happen a lot with you. Maybe some proper training for your personal is in order.
@AmericanAir why was Dani L at gate 55 so mean and even lied about a closed door? ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is it because I got a basic ticket? Welp, get to sleep all night in a Charlotte airport to think about it. #IHateItHere #AmericanAirlines #flightattendant #NonFleek #CatchingFeelinsNotFlights ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@AmericanAir There is no way to charge a phone if it is low on battery. Even the old seats used to have power outlets. I haven‚Äôt been on a plane this shitty between two major cities in a long time
@AmericanAir Why even answer when you don‚Äôt even know that the original....and second plane....both had mechanical delays ?????
@AmericanAir AA1559 now approaching 40 mins at LGA waiting for luggage. No updates or announcements. Where is your customer service?
@AmericanAir my friend‚Äôs bag got lost on NYE and she has tried to deal with your people and they are not being helpful. Any ideas on how to get around red tape? #AATeam
Waiting for over 30 mins at LGA for our bags. Still have not arrived on the belt. Not great @AmericanAir this happens every time I fly into LGA
I‚Äôm confused @AmericanAir . You severely damage this pastor/musician‚Äôs guitar affecting the way he provides for his family, refuse to take care of it...and seem totally fine with it. Is this how you treat everyone? My family is waiting for u to make this right. Ready when u are!
No TV‚Äôs and no outlets to plug into on my AA plane today. WTF? 2020 is not off to a good start with @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Thanks for cancelling my trip without notifying me, and then not offering to rebook when I called customer service. I‚Äôm missing an extremely important event in Los Angeles now. #stranded
When @AmericanAir says don‚Äôt believe the delayed message on your phone and convinces everyone to get on a plane. But the doors are still open. We haven‚Äôt been told anything and I can‚Äôt charge my phone. I could be sitting outside the plane. Charging my phone. Just as happy.
@AmericanAir Hey guys, I left my computer on one of your international flights from LA to Beijing. The automated lost and found processing system I was directed to, appears to be calibrated for domestic issues. What does it take to get to a live person to address this?
@AmericanAir We requested to preboard on both flights and were told it was not allowed.
@AmericanAir hello, I got a refund but I can‚Äôt seem to find out what it‚Äôs for‚Äîany help?
@AmericanAir flying today from STL on flight 590 to PHX. About 20 minutes from landing, our flight attendant Stephanie, gave us a napkin in which was written not only our arrival gate but the gate and departure time for our connecting flight to SAN. How nice!
@AmericanAir We are being told it'll be another 90-105 minutes before we will be airborne. Concerned the crew is going to time out. #AA4475
@AmericanAir You‚Äôve got a big problem at RNO Airport. 30 people in line and lines aren‚Äôt moving - more people showing up all the time.
@AmericanAir Still haven‚Äôt gotten a confirmation email. It‚Äôs been about 5 hours now.
@AmericanAir has made zero progress finding my luggage. I am still pantless and very devastated.
Absolutely ridiculous that all of our scheduled flights (3 flight changes total) were unable to get into the air today (no weather issues here). Now we‚Äôre stranded, unable to report for work tomorrow and losing another day of leave. Way to start off 2020 @AmericanAir
Another huge shoutout to @AmericanAir for not having air conditioning on the current flight from SFO to LAX. Y‚Äôall are heating up. #Ridiculous #AmericanAirlines
Shoutout to @AmericanAir for their amazing employees. My flight from CLT to Miami was delayed and I had to run to my next gate. I asked another gate agent to call and let them know I‚Äôm on my way and they waited for me. Thanks!
@AmericanAir Disappointed that I couldn't get on an earlier flight, with available seats, to the same destination without paying $75 extra per person. A real shame... Delta looks pretty good right now.
@AmericanAir The worst airline of America....
Even more disturbing was the incompetency and lack of empathy @AmericanAir customer service showed during the attempt of rebooking
@AmericanAir the negligence on the maintenance of your plans are starting to show with constant cancelled flights from Miami to PHL and the soonest flight is tomorrow night 8pm. Time is valuable. Outright ridiculous.
It‚Äôs unfortunate that @AmericanAir does not prioritize US active-duty military members when in need of rebooking to get back in time to report for duty due to their delays #AmericanAirlines
And now my bags are missing. Quality stuff @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir y‚Äôall mind if I have a good day?
@AmericanAir And now we‚Äôve been here 12 hours and might not get a hotel room? Shame on you and your company. I‚Äôm holding my patient 3 year old who is exhausted and wants to go home.
@AmericanAir now what are we supposed to do, since we kept WAITING (since 5:00 PM ET) for an answer. As a result, we were not able to book any re-routing options, and now we‚Äôre stuck waiting till 11 PM to POTENTIALLY depart (6 hours later) and yet STILL no update re: issue
@AmericanAir Check your DM‚Äôs please. I DM‚Äôd you about my delayed flight.
@AmericanAir this has been a HORRENDOUS travel experience. Your customer service has been terrible. Absolutely ZERO communication regarding what‚Äôs wrong with AA 2100. All the agents have said is ‚ÄúMechanical issue‚Äù. What a hogwash answer/response that is.
Thank you @AmericanAir, you‚Äôve delayed me, changed gates, and removed me from my seat in an exit row. #unpleasant #comeon
Smh never flying @AmericanAir ever again in my life.
@AmericanAir pls don‚Äôt cancel on me you‚Äôve already delayed my flight home constantly and this isn‚Äôt the first time either.
@AmericanAir Thank you American for responding quickly and handling my issue! Looking forward to traveling with you again in 2020 üôåüèæ
@AmericanAir sitting on runway in Philly. Luggage truck ran out of gas preventing us from taxing. Pretty basic stuff! Make sure luggage car and plane have gas!!!! Very bad experience with AA this week all around.
@AmericanAir My daughters flight from Dallas to Heathrow was cancelled YESTERDAY, and everyone is still stuck in Dallas, over 24hours later !!!! She‚Äôs had one sandwich and one $12 food voucher for her last 3 meals and there‚Äôs not even an estimate for possible time of departure. FIX THIS!!!!!!
@AmericanAir The flight from Dallas to Heathrow was cancelled YESTERDAY, and everyone is still stuck in Dallas, over 24hours later ! They gave out one $12 food voucher for the last 3 meals and there‚Äôs not even an estimate for possible time of departure. American Airlines SUCKS!
Andddd @AmericanAir proves us again how much they suck
Hey @AmericanAir, we‚Äôre in the third decade of the 21st century, and you neither have an entertainment system nor power outlets on a 6-hour flight?
@AmericanAir never again will I ever book a flight to american airlines.
@AmericanAir Thanks! We were told we have insufficient fuel (likely because the pilot didn't turn the engines off at all during the 1 hour and 45 minute delay).
@AmericanAir how long does it take for you to recognize my cancelled flight so that I can request reimbursement? Flight AA5555 Providence to DCA?
so it begs the question: what are you actually buying when you click to purchase a flight off @AmericanAir? just their word they will get you from one point to another, which at this stage isn't worth much. what a racket
@AmericanAir Industry needs a new service metric. How many of your own customers that are late because your flight are you NOT holding the connecting flight when you KNOW they are late. I know a few research journals that will find this interesting!
@AmericanAir I understand delays but when your crew requests something an hour before take off in order to properly take off and we‚Äôre still waiting in an increasingly hot cabin and the flight attendants respond in a patronizing manner, my understanding wanes
I better land before 8:15. Or @AmericanAir we throwing hands. That‚Äôs it
Not a fan of overheating on a plane with no air because we can‚Äôt takeoff. I have a solution, get everyone off the plane and back into the airport until you figure out what to do. üò§ @AmericanAir this is not acceptable. We were supposed to depart at 6:10 pm. #ridiculous
@AmericanAir So which flight from ORD-LAX on 01/23 has seat back personal IFE?
@AmericanAir when you buy a ticket from these guys please bear in mind you're not actually buying any kind of obligation. our outgoing was switched and our return was switched to connecting flight
Absolute worse experience on @AmericanAir in Montego Bay. Just witnessed the crew change the boarding gate and customers sprint to it to get 18 of the rooms available for a full plane of people.
@AmericanAir what's the policy on traveling with small dogs in the cabin?
@AmericanAir Push notifications? YOU are clearly missing the point. Perhaps it‚Äôs why AA has been awarded as the worst customer service of any airline.
@AmericanAir Thank you - but we don't need anything from you further.
@AmericanAir I really hope we do. Thanks
@AmericanAir How many of your own customers are you forcing to sit for 3+ hours to catch the next flight when YOU KNOW your customers are arriving late. UNBELIEVABLE!!!
Broken headphone jacks in a whole row. First they blamed our headphones. Then said ‚Äúif it doesn‚Äôt work it doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù@AmericanAir #bummer
@AmericanAir on a 6 hour flight from Charlotte to sea and NO OUTLETS, seriously????
@AmericanAir I have lived on 3 continents and NEVER had an airline close the gate when the LATE connecting flight is the same airline! Delta NEVER. Etihad NEVER. NZ NEVER. Even Ryan NEVER. UNBELIEVABLE. To improve on time arrivals, you make your own customers to return home late!
Honestly @AmericanAir has done well with a bad situation here and it's awful passengers that have made this a pain in the ass.
@AmericanAir so very disappointed I was supposed to be home yesterday but after flight 1094 was delayed 6 HOURS, we had to reschedule for the next day. NOW we have finally landed in DFW but they will not let us off the plane because the door is broken. It is hot! Get us out! Plz!
Just wanted to get home after 18 hrs of travel and the @AmericanAir staff at JFK gate 32 got me on an alternative flight to get me home quicker, even holding up the boarding process a few minutes to get me on board. So happy to be home, thanks AA for going above and beyond!
@AmericanAir (2/2) After I inquire, announce Gate change. Run to gate, flight closed. Manager Kenneth Wallace‚Äôs response is they don‚Äôt hold flights. He states they KNEW that 5 connecting passengers AA flights were late. STILL didn‚Äôt hold flight. How is this good customer service?
@AmericanAir if you KNOW and seriously how could you NOT...that the incoming aircraft hasn‚Äôt arrived at the gate 3mins before the outgoing flight is sch to board why not give your CUSTOMERS notice of the delay so that we didn‚Äôt have to stand at gate for 30 mins w/o a place to sit
I‚Äôd just like to clarify that I was very impressed with the @AmericanAir gate crew at ROC‚Äôs airport and that is the only nice thing I will say about my experience today
@AmericanAir That's not the point. Orange tag bags came off last. And it's a regular occurrence at MIA. That's not the way that orange bag tags are supposed to work.
@AmericanAir (1/2) American Airlines Flight 2567 from Miami to Dallas Ft. Worth was delayed this morning. When I arrived in Dallas/Ft. Worth, my most recent update shows Gate D6. Sit at D6 until 10 minutes before boarding. I approach gate and ask about about flight. Gate MOVED!
.@AmericanAir sucks! Will be my last flight with you
@AmericanAir I am again at the airport in Philly with a delayed flight and a lost connection. I am just going to tweet about your poor service.
@AmericanAir fuckin sucks. Giving me 10 minutes to make my connection and no flights till tomorrow. Whyyyyy would I ever fly this airline
My @AmericanAir experience this past weekend. 1. Flight from PHL delayed an hour and a half after boarding bc there was no pilot. 2. Land and wait on tarmac 50 minutes (and counting) because the gate already has a plane at it. Might be time to take a look at your operations team
@AmericanAir need some help, can I DM?
28 hours delay at DFW and I can‚Äôt leave to London. I won‚Äôt get to my first day of classes in Aberdeen. This is a joke! @AmericanAir. How come you don‚Äôt give priority to passengers who have been stranded that long?
@AmericanAir 5:20pm flight YESTERDAY, now further delayed to 8pm today! 27hour delay. Three planes unable to fly, but will the forth let us board?! Why are all your planes failing maintenance?
27hr delay on @AmericanAir, fun stuff
I will never fly @AmericanAir again, quote me on that. ‚úàÔ∏èüõ´üõ¨ #thirdworldcountry #CustomerService #absolutejoke
@AmericanAir Yup, totally. I've boarded from the tarmac several times. But in MIA yesterday we were outside with more planes around and we were waiting in line for a much longer time - not just walking from the gate to the plane. And there was more going on outside.
@AmericanAir Went to check my son in for his flight home tomorrow only to find that YOU canceled it! I already talked to your customer service people who were NO HELP at all. Longtime USAIR/American customer here - no more!
remember kids: don't fly on @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir why is flight 4988 delayed? It was suppose to take off at 2:30pm and now it 5:40pm and the flight was delayed again? My mom is going to miss her connecting flight because of you! Wtf?! She hasn‚Äôt been on vacation in so long and deserves to go on vacation!
@AmericanAir Thank you very much for the 1st class upgrade! I‚Äôm ready to return home and this will make the trip that much more enjoyable! Happy New Year!
@AmericanAir thank you so much for the call about the schedule change! First time that‚Äôs happened, and I really appreciate it!! :) #Winning2020
@AmericanAir why is it seeming impossible to get this flight back to England? Looking at a 26 hour delay
@AmericanAir has anyone had the opportunity to check out my most recent DM
Legit the best upgrade to @AmericanAir Executive Platinum phone line in recent years is when you have their highest status they *automatically* put you to a live operator. None of this automated voice nonsense. #blessed
@AmericanAir 2 One hour flights today will end up being delayed a total of 6 hours due to mechanical issues. Not a good look AA says this loyal Gold member.
@AmericanAir Shoutout to whoever is working your social media cuz they got me on a flight tomorrow üëå
Why does @AmericanAir suck so bad?
@AmericanAir Wow! Flight of 3:45 is now due to depart at 4:30pm. Except we aren‚Äôt boarded yet. Oh, and there is yet ANOTHER maintenance issue and we need a new plane! What are the betting odds we won‚Äôt be flying today?
I‚Äôll never forgive @AmericanAir .. delayed my original flight which caused me to miss my connection and now 7 hours of mindlessly walking later I‚Äôm finally on my flight.
@AmericanAir the DFW-LHR delay has been an absolute travesty, how can I proceed to get some indemnification over the 24h+ delay?
@AmericanAir Thanks, the pilot came and kind of calm the heat but we have been here for over 24hrs. Some passengers started their journey yesterday at 6am. Some of us have over 12 hours more after arriving in LHR and still we don‚Äôt have anything for sure.
@AmericanAir That'd have been great if my first flight TO there wasn't at 8. #FFS
@AmericanAir Can y‚Äôall get my bag delivered to my hotel so I don‚Äôt have to stop at an airport to pick it up since y‚Äôall sent my bag without me to my original destination while I went to another airport
Jk @AmericanAir pushed it back another half hour so now I‚Äôm waiting at the airport :(
Hey @AmericanAir Why did you board a plane &amp; then after everyone is boarded and trapped, announce that we don‚Äôt have a captain? And that until you find one, we are stuck sitting on a cramped, stuffy, smelly plane? And you ran out of headsets. And we are now cutting into dinner.
@AmericanAir ill love you forever if you let me change my flight by 24hrs :)
Yo @AmericanAir is TRASH you might as well fly spirit. üôÅ
@AmericanAir bruh our flight has Been delayed 6 hours from Montreal to Philadelphia what the heck is going on
Hey @AmericanAir y‚Äôall just delayed my flight and now there is NO WAY I‚Äôll make my connection in time. I was already on my way to the airport when your app notified me and your phone wait is over 50 minutes. Please DM me ASAP because this is absurd.
@AmericanAir Now back in Miami. Waiting for bags. No orange tags off yet. Rest of bags have arrived. #orangetagsmeannithing
@AmericanAir we are now facing a 10+ hour delay to charlotte from MCO and have received only a $12 food voucher. absolutely ridiculous
Does @AmericanAir fly direct from any DC airport to any airport in Italy? (Is there a site that makes this easier than just tweeting?)
Super thankful for friends who offer serve as your Dartmouth Coach since @AmericanAir is the epitome of the ghetto and their delays are causing me to miss the last bus of the night
@AmericanAir ! Been stuck in MBJ all day 6+ hours. I appreciate safety but if you can‚Äôt fix your plane, tell the truth &amp; let us go. You need to make this right for card holders. AA 844 (16 B &amp; C). Put us on a plane quickly or put us up for the night in Montego Bay and soon!
@AmericanAir I responded to the dm
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm catching the 19.35 flight from Miami to London on 23rd January, but I‚Äôm unable to add my guitar to my luggage as I‚Äôve already got two 23kg bags on my ticket. Could use some advice
@AmericanAir AA2296 3.5 hour delay out of PVR today due to Maintenance. How will we be compensated? #staralliance #revenuetickets
Worst of all? @AmericanAir broke our stroller and could barely use it to move around the never-ending Barajas airport. Oh, we had to circle in the air for 30 more minutes ‚Äúdue to our EARLY ARRIVAL TO BARCELONA‚Äù mind you, we were landing in Madrid. The captain was out of it.
3+ hour delay on @AmericanAir on a 8+ hour flight. Not A SINGLE APOLOGY from the crew. Horrible service. We had to sign up to txt uodates to know WHEN we‚Äôd be leaving because the captain neglected to communicate frequently.
i officially made standby for my connecting flight to SLO :)) it‚Äôs a good day üíõ @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm feeling like getting me somewhere 24 hours late isn‚Äôt the service I payed for, so you finna pay me back?
@AmericanAir if this flight is continued to be delayed without compensation or an explanation, best believe I will be talking this further than a rant on Twitter.
@AmericanAir She‚Äôs not on Twitter. You can DM me. When I asked to speak with the gate agent on the phone to ask questions we were told no. Upsetting when the start of her trip from an international location started smoothly.
@AmericanAir worst airlines ever, worst rules ever, and worst customer services ever. üò§üò°I hated this airlines so much and I will never ever choose them again !!!!!
@AmericanAir Hopefully we will leave ‚Äòon time‚Äô and we arrive on time to catch the connection. i cannot miss another day at work.
@AmericanAir WTF. 4 hour delay and then being put in the last row is such a crappy way to treat a Platinum customer. This is the last straw (although it should have been a long time ago).
@AmericanAir So we can book today the tickets and later only the bags?
@AmericanAir Now I was just informed that there‚Äôs not enough food for everyone on the flight. Do ‚Äúmany , but not all‚Äù of your flight run out of food too?! GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS! And I want my 18 bucks that I had to pay to tweet this too.
@AmericanAir your flight crew is non communicative and we have been on the runway for 2 hours. Isn‚Äôt that against the law?
@AmericanAir thanks for making flight 1506 to Newark a nightmare experience and we haven‚Äôt even left the gate. #RefundME
@AmericanAir wondering how long our flight AA80 from Dallas to LHR will be delayed...23 hrs and counting with little expectation of leaving as the mechanics are still waiting on the plane... #AAteam
@AmericanAir Jan 3rd. Wife and I: Stranded at DFW, flight cancelled to Lake Charles, LA for minor storm. Rebooked to LFT, connect flight arrived late. No room next day flights to LCH. Had to fly to IAH, rent car and drive 2 1/2 hours. Arrive home at 3:00am. No compensation! ü§¨
@AmericanAir You guys have to communicate with your employees. Even more frustrating to have no information all day and be wondering if we‚Äôll get home. Terrible experience.
@AmericanAir some of your employees didn‚Äôt do their job at KPHL and now instead of getting her bag, my girlfriend‚Äôs bag is in Chicago. Exactly what happened???
@AmericanAir hi, I put in a lost and found report for my bag with all my IDs on my flight AA2748. Any idea on how long it would take to get back to me? I have another flight coming up for work. Next week....
@AmericanAir Back at Dallas waiting to board again, and what a surprise... flight is delayed again?! Why are you unable to get a flight off on time? Also we are aware there are spaces in first and business class yet you aren‚Äôt upgrading anyone.
@AmericanAir Why is Flight 5383 arrival time 50 minutes later especially since our plane is already here? No body has said anything about a reason.
Got that refund back from @AmericanAir Thanks guysssüòä
Live from flight #AA1506 MIA TO EWR. Flight has been insanely delayed, no one can get off, it‚Äôs hot, someone in the back of the plane threw up and now the whole cabin smells. @AmericanAir, what is going on?!!!
@AmericanAir I've spent 10 years loyal to you. I flew an earlier flight home. You cancelled my ticket back and told me to buy a new $800 one. No calls. No warning.
Sorry for the rant y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm usually not one to complain, but this experience from beginning of the trip until the end has just been terrible. It‚Äôs really the worst airline experience I‚Äôve gone through. @AmericanAir
Another fAAntastic flight crew on AA4101 DFW STS! @AmericanAir
Typical @AmericanAir Original time 1:18 Then 1:35 Now 1:50 What‚Äôs next?
‚Ä¢ it is starting again. Over 22 hrs delayed flight DFW-LHR reschedule today at 3:45pm has been delayed once again now to 4:05. @AmericanAir what is going on now??
@AmericanAir I have clients in MBJ and they cannot check in online. Is this normal for MBJ??
Currently sitting in the SFO @AmericanAir Admirals Lounge &amp; witnessing a couple break up and argue about seats on their flight home. I Am Shooketh
@AmericanAir can you send me a link in order that my family can claim compensation for a delayed flight from Manchester to Philadelphia in November 2019? We are having trouble finding the relevant section on your website. Thanks Tony Short
So @AmericanAir has screwed me once again showing no loyalty to their AAdvantage Elite customers
@AmericanAir As long as we can be in SF today, any connection in the USA is fine!
@AmericanAir why does it always take so long to get the checked baggage...I've been waiting for 45min...
@AmericanAir Hostess at the airport said we should stay at gate 5. Now checking the app: it says the flight going to Charlotte already departed?! So confused! Can we have clear updates please? What are we supposed to do?! Also, I don‚Äôt care about a connection in Charlotte, can be NYC or DC..
25mins &amp; counting... what‚Äôs the point in having a customer service line if no one is helping? @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I don‚Äôt have a code. I had walked away from my computer and my session timed out. Still no email.
@AmericanAir your response for locating my luggage sucks! I am still waiting and link shows it was picked up at 11:28 pm yesterday and should have been delivered by 5 am this morning ‚Äî-11 hours later and no one knows where it is in transit. Headed to Nordstrom‚Äôs on you !!!
Been waiting to speak to @AmericanAir‚Äôs customer service on the phone for the last 15 mins. Still nothing....flight is tomorrow and I am SO STRESSED. üò°üò°üò°
You wonder how @AmericanAir keeps their nearly perfect on time rate? They change the time of the flight
@AmericanAir THIS COMPANY CONDONES THEIR "CUSTOMER SERVICE" DEPT HANGING UP ON THEIR CUSTOMERS OUT OF ANGER AND AA SIDES WITH THEIR TRASH STAFF THAT MISTREATS THE CUSTOMERS THAT PAY TO FLY ON THEIR PLANES. #INGRATES #DONTFLYAA
I also have a connecting flight that I still CANNOT get a boarding pass for &amp; do not know if they‚Äôll split us up again. Now I have NO boarding passes for either flights &amp; I cannot sit with my partner. Worst airline experience ever &amp; the worst way to end a vacation. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I arrived at DCA yesterday to an alert my bag was delayed. I requested delivery, and the bag tracker shows my suitcase made it to DCA last night. Yet it's still not out for delivery. What's up with that? It shouldn't take 24 hours to get a suitcase!
@AmericanAir your PR team couldn't care less about the wreckage you all have caused. #DontFlyAA
Never flying with @AmericanAir again. Worst experience today with thier rude employees. You are not the ones traveling. Learn to be considerate of those who have been up early and dealing with delays left and right. So so annoyed rn.
just spent the last 4 hrs trying to check in online with @AmericanAir only to keep failing! After semi-successfully checking in, my boarding pass isn‚Äôt received and they split the two of us up for an 11 hour flight! üò°Wth!
@AmericanAir Been stuck in Montego Bay Jamaica with no updates from maintenance. 5 hrs and counting. And the cluster we are hearing from others about this just seems to get worse.
@AmericanAir your own plane having mechanical issues
@AmericanAir That's very passive aggressive of you to say after your customer relations agent hung up on me while I was speaking. You're making it clear that it's none of your concern that your company made me lose the whole process of my trip due to your wrecklessness and carelessness of
Good to know even in 2020 @AmericanAir can make me miss my first connection of the year. Glad they‚Äôre consistent üôÑ
@AmericanAir Thanks for checking. Do you have an update on the incoming flight status?
@AmericanAir That was a complete disaster. Your staff was painfully slow. Didn't accept cash for an UM and made me spend over $10 on issuing temp credit cards. Never again. Thank GOD she made her flight, but only because of a delay.
@AmericanAir were you able to find the fare difference? I need to book this flight to get home and do not want to delay. Info is in my DM
@AmericanAir refund me my money hoe yall flagged my passport as invalid arcadia university yall are next
Typical @AmericanAir Supposed to board now Over the intercom ‚Äúsorry for the delay we have to check on the airbus‚Äù
@AmericanAir MAJOR fail yesterday. Son and young family spent 18 hours traveling from San Antonio to Orlando. Multiple delays in Dallas due to mechanical issues. Not even a food voucher was offered!! This is ridiculous! Poor customer service! Make it right AA!
@AmericanAir Thanks American Airlines for ruining our 21st wedding Anniversary. They switched our flight and will not let us switch to a later time. We used AA miles and even though 2 later flights have plenty of seats, won't do it without a HUGE FEE. No good will 4 AA members.
@AmericanAir my daughter and I just got extraordinary service from Romeo at the main ticketing desk at PHL. Above and beyond what we expected or hoped for. Wanted to let someone in management know. Thanks!
@AmericanAir maybe you should train your first class and business class flight attendants to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù, ‚Äúno problem‚Äù or my favorite ‚ÄúMy pleasure‚Äù rather than a cold ‚Äúuh huh‚Äù to respond to my ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù #RichPeopleProblems
@AmericanAir this will be the last time I fly this airline. Not only will I be stuck in an airport you are trying tobget me to pay for your delay.
@AmericanAir and the excuse given as to the delay for flight 220 bags(still not out) is ‚Äú there were many bags‚Äù really?
@AmericanAir I booked a flight an hour ago and still haven‚Äôt gotten a confirmation email? I don‚Äôt use you guys often but I know other airlines I use frequently I get a confirmation within 15 minutes. Help?
@AmericanAir any realistic time departure on flight 844? We‚Äôve already rescheduled our connecting flight once. Horribly managed situation.
@AmericanAir waiting over an hour and counting for flight 220 bags in philly! Really?
hey @AmericanAir our flight has been delayed about 4 times and over 8 hours of delay from MCO. What can you do to help us today?
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an update update‚Äù is not an update @AmericanAir Do better!
@AmericanAir 2020 has arrived too! Will I be able to receive a birthday tweet for 6th time consecutively?
@AmericanAir Well this is the third time but ok.
We‚Äôre going home tomorrow and yall still cant find my suitcase @AmericanAir ü§Øü§°ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@AmericanAir Kudos to the gate crew at gate 5 at CHO for handling our bumping situation so well. We got a little inconvenienced and they made it right. üëç
@AmericanAir Sres American. Vuelo del 02 ene desde Dallas a Guayaquil. Adem√°s de retraso por casi 4 horas donde viajaba con mi familia, nos hicieron bajar 2 veces del avi√≥n, nos dieron versiones diferentes del retraso..y por √∫ltimo hasta me falta una maleta. Hasta cuando espero?
@AmericanAir A shout out to Don working gate 56 at MCO for 2538. Some how we got unchecked in from the time we arrived at the airport and got passes from the ticket counter and arrival to the gate area. He noticed the error and fixed it.
Flight 4167 @AmericanAir flight attendants thank you. Especially for the service to the numerous kids flying solo.. you treated them like your own kids.. #appreciation
@AmericanAir not appreciating this service at all
Weird policy from @AmericanAir. Apparently purchasing a business class ticket to Cancun means you don‚Äôt get to use the business class lounge at #DFW! Why not make that obvious #CustomerService #Fail
@AmericanAir you guys charged my card twice and can‚Äôt give me my refund till Monday? Why should I wait on your mistakes smh now I‚Äôm stuck at the airport and can‚Äôt pay for baggage cause y‚Äôall got me negative
@AmericanAir Do you think we‚Äôll be able to be back to SFO today (and safely - see my previous tweets, it‚Äôs worrisome as we had technical issues on all our flights so far!)?
@AmericanAir what is the deal with flight 4469 from SRQ to DCA that was diverted? Still waiting for it from Ft Meyers... what‚Äôs the hold up?? Is it ever coming?
You got me fucked up right now @AmericanAir
I‚Äôve never been so pissed off in my life. @AmericanAir y‚Äôall will be hearing from me
@AmericanAir I see that but whoever responded did not read my DM. Can they go reread what the issue is
@AmericanAir. all the inconvienience of unnecessarily checking in carry-on and being rushed to take seats to only have the flight delayed as some late bags arrived from another flight.
The plane is finally here and ready to go @AmericanAir. Could you please have the crew for flight 5859 hurry up with their lunch? The poor gate agent is getting flooded with questions.
Hey @AmericanAir, great job today. Gate agents were great and when I left my phone in the terminal, the Captain helped me find it. Thanks for a nice experience! #americanairlines #travel
@AmericanAir I need someone to respond so I know what I need to do
@AmericanAir you guys suck second time you have cancelled my flight from philly to rochester. Now I get to pay for a rental and drive home. Good job üëç
Any news for flight AA844 @AmericanAir ? (Still waiting at the airport... and no updates!)
@AmericanAir 4455 left one bag at Atlanta and now the baggage system at mia is messed up so no one is getting luggage. It‚Äôs really not that hard American.
@AmericanAir you guys just keep messing up. Once again, my daughters unaccompanied minor info was not entered. This after I asked the agent to double check. What kind of operation are you running here?
@AmericanAir flight AA 290 to Charlotte forced us to check in our carry-on luggage only to discover overhead bins are only 2/3 full. Scrambling to get all fragile stuff out of our carry-on, crew rushed us to take our seats. Now we have to wait for luggage if it arrives. Thanks!
Another year in the books. Another 167k mikes flown and no invite for CK?! Come on @AmericanAir what gives. Six years straight EP.
@AmericanAir Could you please share the reason for delay on flight 5390 TYS to CLT? Incoming is on time. Trying to time my trip to the airport.
@AmericanAir customer service is a joke. On hold for over 30 minutes! Total call length 1hr 8 minutes and counting
@AmericanAir the fact that I have to wait over an hour on a customer service line (8 people ahead of me) because you employ people who move as slow as Chelsea's ass is insanity. If I miss my flight, I'll never fly AA again.
@AmericanAir I tried to help by volunteering to take a later flight out of EGE. Promised I would go nonstop to JFK. Now sitting here American AirLines has screwed us over we are now going no where. Thank you American Airlines for ruining my birthday. GOING NOWHERE
Thanks American Airlines for ruining our 21st wedding Anniversary. They switched our flight and will not let us switch to a later time. @AmericanAir We used AA miles and even though 2 later flights have plenty of seats, won't do it without a HUGE FEE. No good will 4 AA members.
@AmericanAir I have a major problem I need someone to respond to the DM. Boarding me on another flight is not helping.
GAME 14 (7-4 ATS) Finally time for #AEHoops conference play. (If @AmericanAir flew to Binghamton I might‚Äôve attended.) Albany, who WOULD be our arch rival ‚Äî if we could ever beat them ‚Äî visits for a 4pm tip. I‚Äôll begrudgingly take the Danes -4.5. #StrubPicks #BingPride
Wanted to say thank you to @AmericanAir for upgrading my soldier son ticket to first class as he is headed back to his base.. he said to say thank you HOOAH! American Airline upgraded all 5 soldiers getting on board as well !! üá∫üá∏
@AmericanAir Am I permitted to carry a blanket in my arms onto an international flight, in addition to my carry-on and personal item?
Hey, @AmericanAir explain to me how being told we are boarding 6 different times and then being turned around to go sit back in the waiting area because the crew needed a meal makes sense?!?!?!? I wanna like you but I‚Äôm struggling to right now!!!!
Anxiety aside, the @AmericanAir A320-100 I flew on last night was beautiful.
@AmericanAir flying to Turks with an overnight layover in CLT. We called cust serv to see if we will need to grab luggage in CLT. We were told to ask when we are at the airport in the am. We have 2 young kids so need to know if we need to pack clothes/diapers before then. Help?!
I‚Äôm tryna check into my flight online but I can‚Äôt ü•¥ @AmericanAir
Now at 1 hour delayed. @AmericanAir is helpless.
On @AmericanAir #2445 to DEN, most #unfriendly and straight up #rude cabing crew I‚Äôve seen! You are not doing us a favor, we are paying for a service and there are other airline options #justsaying
7- So we wait until 4 pm, board this plane, and fly to Raleigh. It's 9 pm local time when we are standing in another hour long line @AmericanAir for a hotel voucher, as our flight to Chicago left 3 hours ago. From there, we take a shuttle to a hotel.
@AmericanAir your job is putting planes in the air. Do it before I cancel my AAdvantage card.
5- We boarded that @AmericanAir plane, sat for a while, and then were told that while the crew was removing the passenger bridge used for boarding, someone hit the plane with it and damaged the engine. We needed to deplane and wait for another aircraft.
Confused why @AmericanAir has customers check in on their phones 24 hours beforehand, check in AGAIN at the kiosk at the airport, only to wait in another 15 minute line to get a bag tag printed by really rude customer service who quite literally grunt when you ask them a question
.@AmericanAir I don‚Äôt understand why my mom wasn‚Äôt permitted to board flight 4234 from Miami to Jax. #poorcustomerservice at the counter not explaining to her what happened especially since departure time was just delayed by 20 minutes.
Just exited a plane, via stairs, wearing a turban, giant sunglasses, and a scarf. I think that means I'm famous now? @AmericanAir #AskAboutMe #livingmybestlife
3- We got on the @AmericanAir plane the next morning, sat there for about an hour, and were then told that the plane was not taking off due to weather in Iceland. We were not going to Iceland, but apparently this particular aircraft needs an on-route alternate landing site.
Thank you @AmericanAir for making my first experience flying w/you yesterday my last. 3 hour Delay from Chatlotte because of Maintenance issues... I've literally never experienced that. Nevermind I already had a 3 hour layover...so 6 hours in total at CLTüò°
@AmericanAir I was supposed to be in Charolette now getting ready for my connecting flight but we haven‚Äôt even taken off yet.
@AmericanAir flight 1503. It‚Äôs 37 degrees out and it‚Äôs freezing. They won‚Äôt shut the doors and no blankets. Leaving 3 hours late and stuck on this plane in the frigid cold for a half hour with no idea how long this is going to last. Very unpleasant for 1st MCE experience.
@AmericanAir I tweeted over an hour ago but no response. I‚Äôm missing my connecting flight because of the flig delay of AA1849. We are still on the ground.
@AmericanAir thanks for overbooking my flight, now I‚Äôm gonna be late getting back to base ü§ôüèº
@AmericanAir JUST CANCELLED MY SECOND FUCKING FLIGHT OF THE DAY
I‚Äôm a patient traveler. I understand airline employees deal with an incredible amount of stress. However, they can either choose to make your life easier or harder. This @AmericanAir employee chose the latter. Incredibly disappointed in the customer service we received today.
@AmericanAir hola necesito cambiar dos vuelos y la p√°gina no me da la opci√≥n , les envi√© un mensaje privado. Por favor. #aa #americanairlines #ayuda
@AmericanAir thanks for overbooking my flight, now I‚Äôm not going to make it back to base in time üòêüòêüòê
Dear @AmericanAir, So sorry I strayed and flew on another airline. I thought it was a better deal, but I just ended up with headaches and heartbreak...I know you wouldn‚Äôt have done that to me. Please take me back! I promise not to stray again üò¢
@AmericanAir How does family boarding after the priority boarding not exist? It is not child-friendly at all.
@AmericanAir Gald it worked out. Theu were super helpful getting me rerouted. Bag and all!
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs 2020, how about outlets at all seats... ‚Äî An AAdvantage Elite Member (who is stuck charging their phone before heading home)
@AmericanAir Thanks! I don‚Äôt suppose there‚Äôs any way to see if my luggage made the transfer?
Guess I‚Äôm staying in Cleveland another night...thanks a lot @AmericanAir üôÑ
Shoutout to @AmericanAir for easily helping me find a new path when my first flight was delayed AND for letting me upgrade to a seat with legroom. It‚Äôs a good day on American
@AmericanAir the first class flight attendant, Paul, on flight 2502 to Nashville from DFW is amazing!! So attentive! I don‚Äôt have any of my tickets to give him, but he deserved one!
@AmericanAir you have a rude employee named Hazieda interfacing with customers at MIA. I‚Äôve never been treated with such disrespect.
I‚Äôve just realised I have NEVER been on @AmericanAir flight that took off on time!
I don‚Äôt like to complain but I‚Äôve been having the worst experience ever with @AmericanAir ! Always a problem so far, on every flight! SFO to Charlotte, at departure, ‚Äúsorry for the delay but we have to restart the computer‚Äù. With turbulence over the Rockies, that was worrisome.
@AmericanAir Done. I have sent you a DM.
Seriously, @AmericanAir, your response to running half an hour behind is to have your flight staff mistreat your passengers and then to make us sit in an overheated cabin ten feet from the gate for another 45 minutes? Yeah, you deserved a bailout...
@AmericanAir It was more than an inconvenience. 10 hours on an plane without entertainment or wifi is horrible. 10 hours feels like 30. This was the worst flight I've ever been on. You guys can do better and you need to be better.
@AmericanAir I refuse to work with them because of your own Renee Riggins hanging up on me. That's the face you hired for customer relations and she mistreated me yet you want me to deal with them AGAIN? I think you should come up with a better solution
@AmericanAir Delta got rid of theirs 10years ago since it‚Äôs all now computerized process and no long required any extra handling process. This is not an honest way to gouged your last minute psgrs. You already sell very high last min fares. You should be ashamed doing this.
@AmericanAir pls get rid of your last min redemption award processing fee 75.00. You are taking advantage of those who have last min trips especially for emergency situations. There is no extra process for last min res it‚Äôs the same process as if someone is traveling 6mths away
@AmericanAir is the absolute worst fyi
Wow! Great service from @AmericanAir today! Ridiculous delay (not Americans fault) for 2 hrs caused a missed Shanghai flight. Nikiko(sp) met me in DFW &amp; helped confirm new flight, expedite lines, &amp; confirm bags are on the way! Great job American! #thankful
@AmericanAir Is a record locator the confirmation number? I will do that now and thank you.
@AmericanAir Have you considered using silver, copper, or other hygenically positive materials in your uniform designs?
@AmericanAir I just called reservations b/c your website wouldn't let me select a Gluten Free meal for my 8hr flight from LHR to ORD and your agent told me that Special Meals are no longer guaranteed and I should to self-cater. Do you have any respect for your passengers left?
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse. @AmericanAir or the bitch changing a baby‚Äôs diaper next to me in the middle of the airport.
Always leave enough time to get to airport and check-in. Very busy day for the @AmericanAir counter at DCA. All kiosks were in use and there was a long line to see agents. Glad I got there early. A young bro was having a panic because he was too late to make his flight.
@AmericanAir flight diverted then cancelled- rented a car to try and get our connection BUT still waiting on luggage 2 hrs later. Missing vacation time because of this. Not okay. üò§
@AmericanAir my flight 1849 leaving Orlando for charolette is still on the ground. I‚Äôm going to miss my connecting flight 5399 to Indy.
We finna have to square up @AmericanAir my flight has been delayed 3 times üò≠
@AmericanAir Customer service is a joke. You changed my flight and doubled the layover time despite more convenient options at the same price. (Neglected to mention these on your call) Now you want to charge me change fees to get what I originally booked?!? #corporategreed
@AmericanAir you guys are the scum of the earth. How can weather delay me for 2 whole days and your employees have no sympathy or alternative options?? I pray destruction over your company.
Best believe I‚Äôm calling @AmericanAir to see if I can switch the day or tomorrow‚Äôs time
Death to America more like death to American Airlines @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir AA1873 SEA to DFW is delayed. Makes my scheduled connection to AA2636 very tight. Best to reschedule connection to AA2707 now or wait and see?
@AmericanAir has failed today! Still waiting and getting no information or assistance I require! #fail #AmericanAirlines #mco #cookiecutterrwsponses
@AmericanAir Our flight out of ELH now delayed and we will miss our connection home. No flights back to NYC have seats. This has to be a sick joke.
First @AmericanAir flight was so late I had to run to the gate to catch my connecting flight. It's ok, though, that one was late, too. Now we're sitting on the tarmac because the airline cats so much about its customers.
@AmericanAir 2.5 hour delay on a 6:30am flight &amp; somehow we‚Äôre delayed again because you didn‚Äôt refuel during the first delay! üò© Will I make my DFW connection to LGA?
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs been over 48 hours since we purchased the tickets. We want to make sure that we have seats on this plane. Would somebody be able to help us out?
@AmericanAir how you gonna charge $30 for baggage fee and then tell me you have no idea where it is and to pray it shows up ü§™
@AmericanAir Freaking out because I have a tight connection and there‚Äôs no gate available for the plane I‚Äôm on.
.@AmericanAir logic: you can't book award travel for minors on the web, therefore you have to pay double for award travel for minors since you have to call in to book
@AmericanAir Help me get my computer back that I left on board flight 4648 on December 30th, 2019! Charlotte to Key West!
@AmericanAir excellent flight attendants on both our flights today. Flights 1839 and 1288. Please send our complements to the flight attendants.
@AmericanAir how do you miss a half full cup of coffee in the seat back pocket of 9B flight 1665 PBI DCA. Apparently American does run on Dunkin!
@AmericanAir Just a quick #UX idea: When I "send to calendar" my flights, I get two different emails but both are titled with the home airport and then destination airport (i.e., ORD-SAT). For the return trip, reverse the calendar subject (i.e, SAT-ORD) so I know where I'm going!
Yet again, @AmericanAir expresses discriminatory policies: this time against minors. How are you still in business?
Very disappointing experience with @AmericanAir today on our flight to Amsterdam #204. Called (‚Ç¨7) in for a special meal, gluten-free. In flight there was no special meal for my daughter, so she couldn‚Äôt eat at a flight of 7 hours! I expect something done here... #fail
Thank you @AmericanAir for allowing us to change our flight time free of charge! Since this trip is for our honeymoon, I greatly appreciate you guys! Makes things a lot easier for us the day after our wedding!
@AmericanAir your web and phone system are absolutely busted, and I cannot change my flight tomorrow. friend died, need to leave later, and I cannot change my flight. dm and have an actual person in reservations call me
@AmericanAir flight 2361, been on the tarmac over an hour now. What‚Äôs going on?!
@AmericanAir why did y‚Äôall cancel my flight?
Ok, to make holiday travel misery even more miserable, @AmericanAir charges DOUBLE baggage fees for the privilege of having a long layover. Like I WANTED to long layover to begin with!! üò°üò°
@AmericanAir Again the worst customer service, I have a chronic pain condition and your agents denied me accommodation at a hotel! A flight attendant called out sick and now I have to be more than 20 hrs until my last destination without food, no clothing #AmericanAirlines
Just had the worst experience with @AmericanAir customer service representative. I‚Äôm having a bit of a crisis with flights out of Nassau. I was put on hold for a very long time and then hung up on. I just need some friendly and helpful assistance. #pleasehelp
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs not a big deal. I wouldn‚Äôt have got 14 right anyway üòã I was playing in the MAD-MIA flight yesterday (AA 69).
@AmericanAir We wrongfully had to pay $70 for a Lyft ride along with paying new, current rates for hotel and car reservations
So apparently @AmericanAir gives pets and first class members priority over babies and children with disabilities. Appalled üòë
@AmericanAir I DM you as you told me to do so when landed and no response, also asked in miami for the accommodation on the hotel and it was denied
#loyalty to @AmericanAir paid off today with Tina and TC getting us to our flight. #conciergekey is an amazing honor and much #appreciated #myairline of choice whenever possible. Go #AATeam
@AmericanAir ain‚Äôt shit for making they seats this small in coach
@AmericanAir why did y‚Äôall cancel my flight? Your ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù had some serious sass. Y‚Äôall need to fix this.
@AmericanAir Something that I ate on my #AmericanAirlines flight today made me sick and I vomited while in line for security for my connecting flight. (Flight AA136 from LAX to LHR)
@AmericanAir what is the reason for delay on 2209 STL-ORD info appreciated. Trying to #rebook with agents who are helping everyone best they can
@AmericanAir why the long delay for 2209 from stl-ord
@AmericanAir why is the search on you AAVacations site always broken? Tried two devices and 3 browsers already. Why won't you take my money and let me travel??
@AmericanAir time and money that AA won't compensate us for
@AmericanAir ISSUES. We've flown AA our whole lives and the whole deceptive nature of this experience has left such a bad taste in our mouths, we are COMPLETELY DONE doing business with AA because they don't feel the need to make this right. My husband and I have lost precious
@AmericanAir APPOINTED GO-TO FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS, HANGS UP ON THEIR CUSTOMER, THEN WHAT FAITH CAN I HAVE IN THIS COMPANY? AMERICAN AIRLINES DECEIVED THEIR PASSENGERS FOR FLIGHT LJUOOA AND HAVE EVADED COMPENSATING ANY MEMBERS FOR THEIR TROUBLES DUE TO MAINTENANCE/MECHANICAL
@AmericanAir why did y‚Äôall cancel my flight? And then your ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù had some serious sass? Y‚Äôall need to fix this
@AmericanAir to California. Then I told her that her apology has not resolved anything and Renee said, "Well I feel like this conversation is going nowhere," to which I responded, "I absolutely agree" and RENEE HUNG UP ON ME WHILE I WAS SPEAKING. If CUSTOMER RELATIONS, OUR
@AmericanAir got ahold of me once we were seated in a food court inside SFO. Renee said that she apologizes and all she can offer us is great customer service for the next time we board their plane. We couldn't even get mediocre customer service when we were trying to leave DFW
@AmericanAir AA and got AA to connect us to an earlier flight. Shortly after, Renee Riggins (AA-given alias) called me 3 or 4 times while we were going through security at SFO for our flight back, and never left me a voicemail or an extension to call her back. Then she finally
@AmericanAir deceived the passengers due to board the initial flight for LJUOOA by changing the reason for cancellation to weather so that they would not be held liable for passenger compensation. On 12/27/19, we noticed that AA was beginning to delay our flight time so I called
@AmericanAir (which we were planning on taking public transit there had we landed at our original destination). After many emails back and forth between Customer Relations, they said that they are not compensating us for something beyond their control. American Airlines clearly
@AmericanAir seats for the initial flight they cancelled). We finally boarded a plane to SJC and landed close to 7pm there. I missed my interview, we missed our hotel reservation, we missed our car reservation, and had a Lyft bill for a 1 hour drive to get us to Oakland
@AmericanAir cards that appointed us to their website. The AA staff was hostile and smiling condescendingly towards us. We found a flight that would take us to SJC but we had to pay $76 to be able to sit next to each other (we already paid an amount to be able to choose our
So @AmericanAir doesn‚Äôt take verbalized issues over the phone??? Only way you can speak to a representative is if your a booking a flight or need help booking a flight??? What happened to customer service?
@AmericanAir husband and I were frantic to get to California so we wouldn't miss my interview, our hotel reservation, and car reservation so the staff said the fastest way to board a plane even remotely close to SFO was to go online and do it ourselves and proceeded to hand out
@AmericanAir and said that it was due to the weather at SFO and that all flights to go there are booked. IT IS CLEAR NOW THAT THEY CHANGED THE REASON FOR CANCELLATION TO WEATHER TO NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR COMPENSATION WHEN THE PROBLEM ALL ALONG HAD BEEN MECHANICAL PROBLEMS. My
@AmericanAir delayed yet again (I cannot remember the time) and the AA staff stated over the intercom that they are awaiting a new airplane due to the mechanical problems lasting. They delayed the flight to 2 something pm again. Finally, around 2:15pm, they cancelled our flight
@AmericanAir On 12/23/19, my husband and I were to board our plane (LJUOOA) for SFO at 12:54pm from DFW. Shortly before we were due to board, our flight got delayed due to mechanical problems. New boarding time was 1:35pm. Then shortly before we were due to board, our flight got
@AmericanAir We arrived in CLT 20 minutes early on a flight from JFK-1444 and wehave been waiting for our baggage for 20 minutes at carousal D. What is the problem??
@AmericanAir Flight 2538 is delayed creating a really tight timeframe to catch our next flight. Can you help?
@AmericanAir you guys really need to regulate Miami airport better. How do desk attendants show up to the gate 15 min before boarding and hope to accommodate a full international flight?
There is a good chance @AmericanAir has some stake in a lost luggage company. Remember my name.
@AmericanAir After my flight from ONT to DFW to MAD (and back) I can say I was never so confused, pissed, and extorted in my life. I‚Äôve already expressed my concerns to AA and got the typical ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs great, we will do nothing for you‚Äù response. I will NEVER fly AA again. #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir delayed my flight and didn‚Äôt effectively communicate nor provided a reasonable alternative. I‚Äôm missing a lot whoooole day of vacation that is for my birthdayyy. I‚Äôm pissed.
@AmericanAir made me check a bag citing ‚Äúno more overhead space‚Äù despite ABUNDANT overhead space, and if my belongs are lost, I would like this tweet read in high court.
@AmericanAir I just received a text message that my Flight AA4814 from IND to PHL on Jan4 at 1:11PM has been canceled. This is unacceptable and horrendous customer service within a few hours of my flight. I have yet to receive any message on what you guys are doing to fix this!
@AmericanAir my wife I volunteered to changed our flight due to an overbooked flight in exchange for a $300/person voucher but unfortunately, we had a typo on our email to receive the voucher. I‚Äôve emailed customer relations, is there anything else I should do?
@AmericanAir been waiting 53 mins for our bags from 2213 MIA to DCA this morning so far. The baggage office says this is normal and we should just continue to wait. Really? How is this normal?
@AmericanAir has now told us r plane is being towed to the gate ‚Äúin minutes,‚Äù for the past hour. Is there a plane in my future?
@AmericanAir If it was a last resort than how come I wasn‚Äôt given an explanation as to why? And how come the gate agents weren‚Äôt given an answer either?
@AmericanAir 1.5 hours waiting on wheelchair assistance, now 5.5 hour flight delay, First class disabled passenger treatment is not first class. Not even lounge access! #americanairlines #mco #airlinefail
@AmericanAir Thank you I just did
@AmericanAir you need to hire more employees like Denise in customer service maybe your customer satisfaction scores would go up. Thank you Denise for being a compassionate person.
Well thanks to @AmericanAir I missed my connecting flight and now have to sit here for an hour and a half
@AmericanAir It really was! I don‚Äôt have to be a pack mule with a duffel bag üòéüòÇ
I fucking hate @AmericanAir dumb asses
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs not just the rudeness. It‚Äôs the fact that she made us take our one board our and half wrap it in ripped plastic and then when we dropped the bag off there were 3 bags we saw with multiple boards. Now our $400 board will be ruined plus leeanns hatefulness
@AmericanAir Hi I am stuck in Montreal, flight 5702 got cancelled. I‚Äôd appreciate any help with getting rebooked please
@AmericanAir worst travel experience in a long time! Flght delay, poor customer serv agents, missd connect flight, crappy hotel provided, paid for trnsprt bc no shuttle that late, forced to go through customer service line just to prepaid chkd bag, forced to gate chk other bag
@AmericanAir We did not choose basic economy. But when we went to choose our seats there were not any available together. We were told there is a computer program that runs that put families together. We just want to know when this will happen.
@AmericanAir I am really sad and frustrated with unhelpful supervisor in DFW terminal D, my dog wasn‚Äôt allowed to board due acclimation letter not well written (no template online). I will loose money, you will loose a Platinum client for life.
Good morning everyone, just a friendly reminder that I have tried to fly @AmericanAir 3 times and EVERY time they have cancelled my flight. Fuck you American I will never fly you again, thank you for costing me my job interview.
@AmericanAir Well you cancelled it and gave us a worse flight so nah
You know it‚Äôs fucking sad when you stop expecting decent, (not good, or great) just decent customer care from @AmericanAir reps, I‚Äôm not even surprised when they‚Äôre rude anymore it‚Äôs every time
Been sitting on the tarmac for almost an hour. Connecting flight leaves in 15 min... will I make? @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir WARNING to all fellow IHG Ambassador members, if you have been receiving numerous 25% sale announcements, I recommend you do NOT book. The headlines mostly identical but some emails contain fine print non-refundable terms. Corp. will not refund.
@AmericanAir I was supposed to be on flight AA5702 from Montreal to Charlotte and am going to miss my connection because of a plane issue. PLEASE RESCHEDULE.
@AmericanAir needs to stop delaying my flights!!!
Love when I see a female pilot! Way to go @AmericanAir #GirlPower
I‚Äôve been sitting on this plane for an hour....@AmericanAir ü§¨
@AmericanAir The team at the airport was actually very unhelpful and rude. Two people just said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what happens when you miss your flight‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt even the case in the first place. Customer service over the phone was much better. Unfortunately we will be 7hrs late now though....
@AmericanAir we‚Äôve apparently called 4 times for a jetway driver at DFW Gate 17. It‚Äôd be super cool to get one of those so we can deboard as a lot of people have connecting flights.
@AmericanAir should be ashamed. They do not care about their customers, they are not hospitable, they are not a solution-based airline, customer service, what customer service? Absolutely unacceptable, I fly year-round, this is a first.
@AmericanAir We are a family traveling with a three-year-old and there wasn‚Äôt any seats together for the three of us. We chose the option to have seats assigned for us. We would like to know when this process happens. Thank you for your help.
@AmericanAir Thanks AA for making an ‚Äúexception‚Äù for 2 uniformed army soldiers to go through security w/o their boarding pass because they arrived for check-in after the counter closed the flight but wouldn‚Äôt let me get on that same flight because I‚Äôm in civilian attire.
My first flight as a @AmericanAir EP is Monday. 4 segments this week and already upgraded on both flights that have first class. Not a bad start.
@AmericanAir any chance I can get my flight rebooked? Stuck in Montreal after being on the runway for 2 hrs and now we‚Äôre heading back to the gate. Appreciate any help! Currently on flight 5702 YUL to CLT
@AmericanAir "working on some paperwork" yeah sure
@AmericanAir can you hold flight AA1489 I‚Äôm running late from my connection ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
@AmericanAir left the gate an hour ago, still driving around DFW. No word from the mute crew . Very poor service
I see why people don‚Äôt like flying @AmericanAir they have the rudest most condescending employees üôÑ
I will never fly @AmericanAir ever again they canceled a reservation I paid for and have left my son stranded and don't even care. Pay a little extra fly a company that CARES
My plane got delayed half an hour. @AmericanAir ... is weather becoming an issue for flights from Cleveland to Chicago?
@AmericanAir hi when I booked my ticket I put in my qantas FF number in but didn‚Äôt change the airline to Qantas it was left as AA by mistake.. any help to update this please ...
@AmericanAir your fly 188 crew has the communication skills of a rock
@AmericanAir Thank you for replying ‚ò∫Ô∏è I got my standby flight to Phoenix and hopefully will get it for my connecting flight to SBP as well :))
@AmericanAir hi please help me, i lost my license and i have a flight in 5 days. am i still able to fly without photo ID?
@AmericanAir And since you want to make excuses, why did they let 2 white passengers more to that seat well after takeoff?? After I already asked??? Seems weird they got too move
@AmericanAir i‚Äôm so disappointed in your service. I flew from london to dallas yesterday and was immediately disgusted in the way your flight staff disrespected me, my family, and all passengers on flight.
@AmericanAir The fact you have to justify your poor service shows how little you care l. It‚Äôs easy, just do the right thing. Not make excuses for your lack of caring
Spoke with Vanessa at @AmericanAir bag handling. She was a doll and finally figured out where my bag was!
@AmericanAir I am concerned. There was a mixup on the plane and I took someone else‚Äôs purple samsonite . On flight 50 from Dallas to Heathrow this morning When I realized on terminal 5 someone from security picked it up and As I had to connect I could not inquire about my own bag
I made numerous phone calls last night/this morning and spoken to quite a few confused representatives @AmericanAir , but I finally got my luggage. Of course I had to make an additional trip to the airport to pick it up and it wasn‚Äôt where they said it would be. Oh well!
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve already left. The agent directing people to the carousel at baggage claim told me to file a claim online or via phone. Y‚Äôall are such garbageeee
#firstflight of 2020 and such a pleasant greeting by Tina on our flight this early snowy morning. PIA to CLT @AmericanAir has the #best #AATeam
Mot going to make it, am I, @AmericanAir?
Finally received my luggage. Thanks @AmericanAir
I still haven‚Äôt gotten my suitcase and @AmericanAir claims it was delivered... but it wasn‚Äôt. So the few souvenirs I was able to get from what will likely be my last trip ever with my mom are now missing.
@AmericanAir Still no bag... now they claim it‚Äôs been delivered, but according to the parties at the location, it was not delivered. Sitting in ICU with my mom and glad for a gift shop that sells (very expensive) changes of clothes.
@AmericanAir Flight 782 arrived at PHL more than 35 minutes ago. A few bags were delivered after 20 minutes. There are more than 30 people awaiting bags.. Your baggage handling is less than great.
@AmericanAir flight from RIC just landed in phi. Need to make flight 847 to SDQ.
@AmericanAir What is the status of flight 3500 flying 1/4/2020 from GCK to DFW. Shows still awaiting takeoff. What is the arrival time? Thanks
@AmericanAir pathetic customer service trying to check in unaccompanied minors at s06. 30 minute wait time, now with agent &amp; here over an hour &amp; still not checked in! Unacceptable! This gives new meaning to arriving 2 hours early!
@AmericanAir Can you tell me if this is possible at a flight on 2020/07/21 to book baggage today for 7 persons?
@AmericanAir Delayed flight 752 to PHX. No gate communication or gate agent. Gate screen still shows the previous flight.
@AmericanAir our flight is taking off now and my husband lost his phone at gate B10 in the Charlotte airport. Can you help? üòñ
Omg @AmericanAir you guys are the best! You upgraded me to first class y‚Äôall are the best!
@AmericanAir Interesting considering I spoke to an AA attendant directing foot traffic at LGA who said call AA or file a claim online so....what‚Äôs the truth?
Hey @AmericanAir which plane from PHL-LAX on 01/23 have screens? Just dont know which flight to pick.
@AmericanAir Rita at customer service saved the day ! She put me in stand by for the next flight and was so courteous and nice compared to the other lady. Crossing fingers I make the flight #AATeam
@AmericanAir #avoidamericanair first we had more than an hour delayed flight and now on my way back the customer service is the worst I have ever seen in more than 200 flights done so far. #americanairneveragain #avoidamericanair #worstcustomerservice
@AmericanAir yet again issues with AA..every 15 minutes they need 15 minutes more....Ridiculous. What is going on with AA93
@AmericanAir I have politely asked your staff for help and was told I was in the wrong line. After changing lines I was told to go back to the line I was previously in. I‚Äôve checked in but can‚Äôt print my bag tags on the kiosks. Customer service is rude! #AATeam please help
Christmas Day &lt; getting a complimentary bag check with @AmericanAir üòÑ it honestly made my day!!
Traveling @AmericanAir has been a horrible experience. Very rude and unhelpful as I sit here in standby even when arriving 47minutes before my flight. First time trying them and will be my last!
@AmericanAir am about to miss my flight. The who is currently working at the Houston airport has been telling people to go to different lines causing a lot of confusion. Please help
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm at the Houston airport and have already checked in but can‚Äôt print my bag tag using the self service kiosks. I just need to check my bag in please help. I‚Äôve been told twice to go to two different lines already when I was in the same line previously. Please help
@AmericanAir why bother scheduling early flights if your company can‚Äôt produce a crew????
Hi @AmericanAir i really appreciate being lied to and losing my luggage. Shame on you
@AmericanAir i‚Äôm having the WORST travel experience here in Panama (PTY)
i missed my flight üôÉ it‚Äôs a very very slow morning here at the airport for @AmericanAir all the workers seem to be sleeping idk, now I‚Äôm on standby for my 8:39 am Phoenix flight üôÉ
And @AmericanAir I stayed on the phone for 42 min yesterday to talk to someone about this and got hung up on as soon as I connected with someone soooooo what y‚Äôall finna do about this
.@AmericanAir get this plane moving im tired of sitting here
Maaaan @AmericanAir ruined my hard case luggage and I‚Äôm so mad cause I can‚Äôt find this color anywhere ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
So @AmericanAir has my bag, knows where it is, and only needs to put it on the next flight for my location. Not rocket science, right? I file a report for it, and somehow after doing that, they lose it! We‚Äôve somehow managed to take two steps back!
@AmericanAir yo dawg, I want thank Lisa (RDU kiosk for AA 337 to Wash Reagan) who was extremely helpful with switching my flight from something that was gonna take a whole day traveling to a simple 2 hour trip. Saved me a possible 8 hour layover
@AmericanAir That‚Äôs the worst excuse I‚Äôve ever heard. A billion dollar company has to ‚Äúwait on new info‚Äù from a different section of that SAME company? How long are you willing to wait for new info? Should I expect something in 2021 in that case? What does it take to get something done?
@AmericanAir I already DM you and of course I haven‚Äôt get any response
Amazingly, our lost bag was waiting for us at Heathrow this morning. Thank you @AmericanAir for providing a free two week holiday to Dallas for our bag üß≥üèù
@AmericanAir I hope you you feel god over charging military for no reason . Nothing American about that
@AmericanAir Wasted a whole Friday trying to at least get defunded for the seats we paid to reserve and could not sit in. Why do I have to call to try to make it right smdh
@AmericanAir you guys better not shut the door on me for my connecting flight to Phoenix and then to San Luis oBispo - i SWEAR
@AmericanAir I just want you to know that for the rest of my life every-time I hear ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù I‚Äôll shudder as I remember the sub-par service I received from this joke of an airline. I also won‚Äôt forget the time I went abroad and didn‚Äôt have my clothes or anything for a week :)
Whew these flight attendants on this @AmericanAir flight are awful. I don‚Äôt understand how people can work in these fields and act like they are constantly irritated by people. Choose a new career path.
@AmericanAir Definitely going to do so!
That would be completely fine if I still had about half a week here. But no, I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve only got one day let here and ZERO of my bags. Other people got their bags? What‚Äôs so hard about getting me mine? @AmericanAir
I‚Äôve been on my honeymoon for about a week now and it‚Äôs been great except that absolutely nobody at @AmericanAir cares at all to help me get my bags. They told me multiple times they‚Äôre ‚Äúreaching out to their baggage team‚Äù and I still haven‚Äôt heard anything.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve already been rebooked and as a result forced to a long layover at my destination. You guys assume no responsibility and I should be issued a voucher for my troubles. This is rediculous and I regret ever booking with your company.
@AmericanAir Definitely have the worst customer service ever! A flight attendant called out sick and now I have to wait 20 hours to my final destination without hotel accommodation, no clothing, no refund no nothing #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir can‚Äôt even get my next flight until 6pm now so I‚Äôm spending the day in Phoenix lmao
@AmericanAir And now because of this #inconsistency we‚Äôve missed our flight home. Thanks, American! Now 6 people have to be on standby for an unknown time because of this and our day is completely changed.
@AmericanAir does not care about its customers. 12 hour mechanical delay causing a missed connection. No food provided, one 12 dollar food voucher, forced to pay an upgrade so I can make sure to have a seat on my rescheduled connecting flight on the following day. Never again.
@AmericanAir #AATeam have a connection this morning coming off a BA flight into LHR and then to PHL only 90mins between flts any need for a priority security going from BA term 5 to AA term 3 at LHR?
Nap time till boarding! 1st class for less than my power bill and booked same day! @AmericanAir that‚Äôs üî•!
Ofcourse my flight is delayed and I‚Äôm gonna miss my connecting flight. This is a terrible start man .. I‚Äôm already upset about leaving my family, these assholes making me angry at this point. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve had similar issues with a carryon where I LITERALLY left one AA flight for a connection and was told on the connection that my carryon (a small 16‚Äù wheeled suitcase) was too big when it clearly wasn‚Äôt. Again, #consistency
@AmericanAir your answer is not highlighting the inconsistency within my complaint about the sudden change in policy being upheld. the bats have never been a problem for him before.
@AmericanAir That isn‚Äôt an explanation - if many AA flights allow it, they should all allow it. Or you need to better train your agents at other airports so we don‚Äôt run into unexpected issues minutes before our flight.
@AmericanAir I have been on standby to board my flight three times. I‚Äôm on my fourth standby. How can I get onto my next flight?
@AmericanAir Please explain why my brother can fly 5 times through AA with his baseball bats poking out of his checked in bag, came to Puerto Rico through 3 flights like that, but leaving it‚Äôs now not allowed and we have to pay $40 to wrap the bats. #consistency pls!!
@AmericanAir can you tell us why 2.5 weeks ago my brother was able to travel on 3 flights with baseball bats on a CHECKED IN bag but now trying to go home we're being charged $40 so that we can wrap them in plastic?
Had the toughest experience with @AmericanAir From missing my flight to go back home because the people who check passengers in left an hour before. They canceled my ticket back because now it counted as a ‚Äúno show‚Äù. Now the same day change is unavailable. #americanairlines #help
@AmericanAir You always try your best, it‚Äôs just never good enough. So maybe try harder
@AmericanAir congratulations on being the worst airline for 2020, great job!
@AmericanAir Perfect! Thank you for quick response üòä
@AmericanAir When I bought my flight ticket, I couldn't add my checked baggage. Will I have this choice at the moment of proceeding my online check-in? Thank you!
‚ÄúDo you like Trump?‚Äù ‚Äî@AmericanAir flight attendant to my 12-year-old daughter
I‚Äôve flown about every airline in the USA. Tonight‚Äôs flight just reminds me why I fly @AmericanAir most of the time. Best in the business. Never again will i fly another airline
@AmericanAir I just want to get home to my family m. Your team sucked it tonight.
@AmericanAir I'm going to DM you.
@AmericanAir really? My ten year + means nothing? When I'm hurting you choose to have me arrested?
@AmericanAir DM with record locator sent.
@AmericanAir Already did and the ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù Cameron didn‚Äôt help at all.
@AmericanAir last month a six hour delay, now my bag won‚Äôt be here until tomorrow afternoon. Can you do anything right? Need to start using another airline
@AmericanAir I called and spoke to one of your representatives. My luggage is still in Phoenix and I will most likely not receive it before I need to be to the port. Plus I was told I would need to pick it up at airport. I spent $30 for a checked bag, yet no bag!
@AmericanAir you don't know me - I'm just a customer of yours. I booked trip from California to Philly see my dad in the ICU... He's in a bad way. Today I had to make the hardest decision in my life to pull the ventilator - in accordance with his health directive.
I‚Äôm sorry to all of #BillsMafia that had to fly to Houston with @AmericanAir today. Not only were all my flights delayed/ had problems, but they forced me to check my carry on and then they lost it at a different airport and won‚Äôt take it off the ramp for my friend who is thereüòä
@AmericanAir after one already cancelled flight and an overnight hotel in Tokyo idk why your customer service sucks, and then an additional two hours in line to simply check a bag. Y‚Äôall are killing me.
Thank you @AmericanAir for your help resolving this for me!
Best advice for 2020 so far: never fly @AmericanAir üíØ
hey @AmericanAir - flight AA1435 just landed. You had a blonde, middle-age, flight attendant engaged in a conversation with a passenger nearby in which the attendant informed him that the U.N. recently ‚Äúlegalized bestiality because they want to normalize pedophilia.‚Äù
@AmericanAir It's flight 0489 if that helps
@AmericanAir you were DNI three g Hours. I may have had but too much and and I got detained y police?
@AmericanAir so we landed at DFW over an hour ago now, couldn't deplane for 30 minutes because there was no gate agent and now we still don't have our bags, did everyone working for you at DFW quit? Can you ask some other airlines for help?
Well I made it to Miami, but I don‚Äôt have my luggage! One flight delay required me to book another flight, then the second flight gets delayed too, then my luggage gets sent back to Phoenix. I need to be on a ship at Noon, Thanks for making this stressful! @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir so after our flight was cancelled you have put us up in a hotel. Thanks for giving us a voucher! Oh wait, the voucher you gave us doesn‚Äôt work! Phoning you has given us the option to pay ourselves or take a 90min round trip back to the airport to get a new voucher!
@AmericanAir Domestic sure, but you really need to improve the professionalism of your staff on international flights. heck they even looked like they had already been on the job for 12 hours before the flight started.
So my @AmericanAir flight to philly got delayed for over 6 hours because there‚Äôs no one to fly the plane? Ridiculous
@AmericanAir worst flying experience ever. Land at 1130 and 1210 not a single person from the flight has their bag. Sick work
@AmericanAir free flight 489. We have been sitting at the gate for 25 minutes now at DFW and they claim hey can find an agent to open our door. What a bunch of clowns. These are the folks we trust our family‚Äôs safety to and this is how they operate. What a joke
i like @AmericanAir for domestic, but int'l they are god awful. My fiancee now refuses to fly on them internationally even though we have a ton of pts. I guess the FA basically blindly passing our food tray like we were animals and hitting her with it yesterday was the last straw
@AmericanAir Thanks, I will try that, but I only have the AA Locator
@AmericanAir DO BETTER! We had to wait for an hour at GRR because you don't have enough staff, or pay enough people, to actually unload your damn planes, and your people at the airport have just been giving us the run around and making poor excuses! I will NEVER fly AA again!
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve filed a claim, and they are unsure where exactly my bags are even though they arrived in Charlotte at 6pm EST
@AmericanAir That is the job of your flight attendants to figure this out not us paying customers. Totally ignoring the safety of your passengers here. We are fortunate we did not need to use the emergency exit. Because they would not have been able to operate it.
@AmericanAir neither of my checked bags arrived from Charlotte to Fort Myers. Can you give me a status update and what flight they‚Äôll be on?
Why did I fly @AmericanAir ????? The worsttttt
@AmericanAir you cancelled our flight then gave us a hotel voucher, then cancelled the voucher the next day when the hotel tried to charge it. So they charged our card. Is that legal?
@AmericanAir My bag is on your plane and can‚Äôt be obtained. And exactly what medical assistance is going to give me the tablets I take daily!? You also haven‚Äôt answered my comment in regards to compensation.
@AmericanAir You can count on it ‚ù§Ô∏è
@AmericanAir stuck in Philly after #AA734 goes ‚Äútechnical‚Äù after leaving the stand. 2 hour delay so far. Seems to happen quite frequently on this route... Any news?
@AmericanAir Somebody or maybe everybody needs to get their head out of their duffle bags!!!!
@AmericanAir The new gate was at the opposite end of the terminal, and the cherry: The new aircraft we were sent to had a KNOWN, OPEN mechanical issue. Oh the irony. Who is awake and doing quality control on regional carriers at American Airlines???
@AmericanAir We are booked on flight AA 4075 out of Dallas. We were told at the gate that the plane had mechanical issues that would be resolved shortly. Delay after delay, we were told the plane would not be ready and were assigned a new aircraft.
@AmericanAir The issue has been resolved but it was not fun. 0/10.
@AmericanAir You have delayed the flight again until the morning! We now only have $12 each voucher for dinner, breakfast and lunch - no medication and toiletries. Will we be getting compensation?
@AmericanAir Well these two needed assistance to walk onto the plane and could not lift their own luggage to the overhead bin. And struggled to get into their seats. And needed assistance to get off the plane. Clearly not able to perform in an emergency
@AmericanAir Happy New Year! I love your brand and would love to find some creative ways to work together. Please send me a direct message. Thanks!
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm loyal as the day is long, but I‚Äôve never been treated by a nagging gate agent like I have tonight. Frankly I don‚Äôt care about her 45 minute commute she keeps reminding us all of in the gate area. PS she‚Äôs already gone and I am here. #ord #G5 #imoutofhourstoo
I did not want to spend my Friday night on hold with @AmericanAir but here we are... üòí
Does anyone happen to know the contact email, fax, or address for @AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines disability services dept? I‚Äôve asked them 4 times on DM, &amp; they keep typing the same robotic response that doesnt make any sense. Its like there‚Äôs an actual robot behind the keyboard.
@AmericanAir Forcing an overnight stay after an 8-hour layover is not as soon as possible. Be a pioneer and change the industry standard.
@AmericanAir question on emergency exit row assignments. Just came into O‚ÄôHare on a flight out of lax and two people in the exit row were clearly not going to be able to open a door in a emergency. Is this how you ensure our safety in an emergency situation?
@AmericanAir epic fail!!! Spent a thousand dollars to have our seats upgraded to still be put in the back of the plane and then leave our luggage in NC #majorfail #neverflyingyouagain
@AmericanAir Sorry that I complained. The failure was entirely my fault. I will try to be a better passenger in the future.
On the plus side we found a very similar route for only 1,000 more miles per person in the same cabin but on a partner airline and not @AmericanAir. We can‚Äôt choose our own seats. What a shame.
Literally midway through booking an award ticket on @AmericanAir and the mileage required to book the route doubled during the booking process. Just by looking at a fare.
@AmericanAir great flight attendants on my recent flight to Z√ºrich. Thanks! #platinumpro #aa #firstclass
@AmericanAir Thank you for your help. I really appreciate it! Happy New Year.
Hey @AmericanAir - I hope checking the ‚Äúon-time‚Äù departure box on flight 2177 today was worth it. Closed the door in our face when our internatnl connection was too short to begin with and somehow you didn‚Äôt have a gate for our on-time first flight, making us later. #cryingkids
@AmericanAir My current experience: 1st flight cancelled, second flight delayed twice for a total of 2 hours. Makes me miss the connection. Wait 2 hours for next flight out. This flight has now been delayed twice again for 1.5 hours still have yet to board. GSO&gt;CLT&gt;CMH. Plz Help
@AmericanAir Begged them to pull bags and put on flight with me. AA REFUSED. Instead AA is pulling bags AFTER I depart on new flight, then shipping tomorrow AFTER I arrive in London and file a claim.
@AmericanAir Wow, the least you guys could do is refund the baggage fee. I contacted you via your web form within 24 hours and still haven‚Äôt gotten a reply.
@AmericanAir No, I‚Äôm waiting at the airport for the flight.
@AmericanAir Your response makes NO sense. Why do you overbook and bump passengers and let those that purchase that day have their seats? Do better.
And flight is cancelled. Thanks for a fun 8 hours inPHL airport. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been trying to get home since Thursday night and I‚Äôm stuck in Philadelphia for the night... 3 days to get from FL‚Äî&gt;PIT and all you could do while we were stuck at PHL for 6 hours was a $12 meal voucher... good god
@AmericanAir The flight has been delayed until tomorrow 3:30pm. The worst part is i travel half the world to be with my family and booked the returned flight to make it on time for work. Now i have lost precious family time and one working day which will be deducted from next holiday time
@AmericanAir But your company was the one that charged my credit card. Can't you guys be of help also?
@AmericanAir what is the update on 2733? Gate agent doesn‚Äôt know anything
@AmericanAir Still crazy to me. Trying to get on a later flight to Tulsa, which has openings. Paid for a first class and get lower than basic economy treatment. Just not a customer friendly airline. Hope to never use your airline again after this.
@AmericanAir Long way from AAmazing as it was just announced no power, no WiFi and no IFE on this plane. #embarassing #terriblestart
@AmericanAir Too bad they won‚Äôt be able to sit together unless they pay extra. #nickleanddimedtodeath
@AmericanAir is there anyway I‚Äôll be able to get back to Dallas, TX anytime soon?
@AmericanAir what's going on with AA2733. Please post proper updates...instead of simply delaying the departure time by 30min. Extremely stressful situation here...
@AmericanAir What does this even mean? Are we going to get compensation for our five hour plus delay? Or are you not willing to state that here for everyone to see?
Thanks @AmericanAir always sending Me into Dallas for a delayed transfer rebooking Me to arrive late and boarding last to the back of the plane #NotMuchMore
@AmericanAir Any update??? We are all still waiting. Now have been waiting 3 hours. 2733
@AmericanAir get your act together.. had a 2 hour layover in Dallas, yet somehow you forgot to load my bag Into the plane and it won‚Äôt get here for another 1.5 hours??? Are you kidding me? Half my flight is in the same situation as me #Smdh
@AmericanAir just boarded my flight in MIA. Why the heck are you walking all the passengers outside on the tarmac with absurd decibel levels? All your people have hearing protection, but the passengers don‚Äôt rate apparently?
@AmericanAir I just DMed the record locator and sincerely hope this is not the end of the conversation now that it‚Äôs conveniently out of the public eye
@AmericanAir why do you overbook flights then bump passengers who have been at the airport for 8 hours and had their tickets for over 3 months? Do better.
@AmericanAir boarding groups 1-8 *25 people get on. Rest of the plane in group 9. We are PEASANTS. #peasantsuprising
@AmericanAir Kindly help me resolve the issue that I have booking your flight through Kayak Mobile App.
@AmericanAir Are you going to cancel? Just let us know pls lol.
@AmericanAir I booked a flight with Kayak mobile app, I was informed that the flight ticket will be sent to my email once it's ticketed and that it takes 3hrs for that to happen. It's past three hours and I'm yet to receive any email to this effect. My card has been debited too.
@AmericanAir Your 4 hour flights between DFW and Liberia fall across lunch and dinner. But you don‚Äôt pack enough popular snacks like fruit &amp; cheese or hummus so even in row 24 we‚Äôre left with dog biscuits &amp; kibble. You can plan better than that!
@AmericanAir Broken plane, then parts... now crew. The first announcements about what‚Äôs goin on was at 6pm since we departed the plane hours ago.
@AmericanAir yo your pilots are trash b. Dude has just kept us on the tarmac for an hour now saying that the runway is too icy for lift off. He needs to sack up and send it.
@AmericanAir way to treat my mom for flight 937 from JFK to GIG making her wait for a wheelchair and telling her she couldn‚Äôt make a call from an office while she is waiting for one. Shame on you! üò°
@AmericanAir are you going to reply to me???
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm a gold status member. How can I get on the upgrade lists? It‚Äôs wanting me to pay for upgrades. Can you assist?
@AmericanAir my flight from DFW to LHR was supposed to leave at 5:20 pm. Now it is schedule at 10:45pm. I have lost my connection to DXB. I will not make it to work on time.
@AmericanAir Thanks. If you could be more specific, we could brag about you the way people are bragging about and proud of Aer Lingus.
@AmericanAir easily have had the worst travel experience of my life the past two days waiting on your delayed planes and poor communication. I will never fly AA again
MY BAG IS IN PARIS LMAO I FUCKING HATE @AmericanAir R U FUCKING KIDDING ME i have zero clothes in dallasü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ &amp; ill be here till sunday hate everything and yall the most
@AmericanAir tried cancelling my ticket to Dubai in light of recent political events in the middle east and I was informed by the customer service rep, it wasn‚Äôt possible. What kind of irresponsible customer service is that from a supposedly American company?
Thanks, @AmericanAir, for your amazing web special. Roundtrip to #SYR for 19K miles. You da best. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
@AmericanAir I think you need to retrain your staff in customer relations. Can we get an AA employee to Gate 25 in Dallas to tell your flight full of CUSTOMERS what is going on instead of ignoring us with an empty desk?
@AmericanAir fancy updating those at DFW D25 AA80 on our delayed flight? Currently 3 hours delayed and no one to update us.
@AmericanAir I spent the entire flight uncomfortable and am still confused as to why he was allowed to sit in one seat when he needed to purchase two.
@AmericanAir Oh! And delaying a plane full of people so one flight attendant can catch a ride to LGA? Come ON!!!
@AmericanAir Yes I understand that but when I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs too big and then I see at least 30 people after me board the plane with considerably bigger carry on bags then mine? That‚Äôs when it‚Äôs not ok.
Also, @AmericanAir please let the Captain of 3180 know how great he was ‚Äî very informative announcements that folks don‚Äôt usually get on Eagle flights and he also helped some disabled pax with their luggage.
@AmericanAir All the passengers on flight 5233 need some type of compensation
Hey @AmericanAir , I was lied to by your agent on the phone. Very confusing to why they feel like that is ok. I DM‚Äôd you the details, please address this ASAP.
@AmericanAir The plane was full and there were no other options.
@AmericanAir I need to be compensated for the bullshit y‚Äôall pulled today. Refund or free flight anything less is ridiculous
@AmericanAir come on. Don‚Äôt put us on flight 5658 CLT to JAN without double checking the error message. That‚Äôs rookie crap. You already pulled us off 2 hours ago. A second time is BS
@AmericanAir, reaching out to see if your customer service is as good as advertised. I know from watching many of your safety videos that ‚Äúgreat is what you‚Äôre going for‚Äù. 3-hour delayed flight, 1/1/20, DFW to COU, flight #5716. No compensation offered. Please help. Thanks
The women was very concerned about her flight so the officer radioed and the American Airlines supervisor showed up at the scene to calm her nerves, assuring her that he would see to her ticket personally. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Do you offer Helping special needs adult to gate
@AmericanAir Further given the amount people are paying yall for a single seat regardless of position is astounding and should be made up. Not just me but everyone who has missed their connections tonight.
@AmericanAir Excuses! I tried rebooking through the URL. Site wouldn't load (not surprising given your quality of service). Gambled missing boarding and found out I actually lucked out in doing so because next flight wasnt until 11am tomorrow.
Another flight delayed!!! @AmericanAir keeping up their standards of never leaving or arriving on time. #dontflyamerican if you wanna be on time.
Ah the old five hour delay from @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Wheelchair assistant was never offered, I will send her info
Further @AmericanAir the amount you're costing me to go to and from the airport tonight then tomorrow plus changing car rental is ridiculous. Your customer service at the airport was useless. About as useful as Trump and Boris Johnson in the same room or the US Senate. Piss poor
@AmericanAir The 787 has been sitting in LA all day! Why didn‚Äôt you perform maintenance earlier today to identify the problem?
@AmericanAir Instead I was told it was full and they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to even look. Feels great having status ...
Will American Airlines ever get their shit together,!?? @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir delayed flight and no compensation? No EU citizen should ever travel with you! No communication and rude staff, on top of a 5 hour delay.
@AmericanAir Please I‚Äôm at the airport right now. I asked to speak to supervisor and they told me no one is around to speak to me.
Thanks @AmericanAir due to your ineptness I wouldn't have made the connection flight. Now my bags won't get there until 6s hours after I arrive because you wouldnt pull them. Because of this you've messed with schedules plans &amp; car rentals. #useless I've had poos more productive
Never flying #AmericanAirlines again! Customer Service is horrible! South Carolina - Charlotte so racist is ridiculous! #Nora agent + #Scott agent! @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Made it to gate while group 6 was still boarding. You gave away our seats even though we made our connecting flight. This is making us miss our train home so we have to pay for uber. GREAT JOBüôÑüôÑüôÑ
Forced to check my perfectly sized carry on bag while watching others bring noticeably bigger bags onboard is beyond annoying @AmericanAir. There hasto be a better way than letting some overworked airport agent randomly decide to take my bag!!
YALL ARE FUCKING UP @AmericanAir !!!!!
@AmericanAir you have failed us. SFO to CLT Flight delayed from 1:30pm to 7pm and no food voucher. Not communicating with guests. Disappointed. Won‚Äôt be flying American Airlines again any time soon.
@AmericanAir I just got my refund request rejected because I didn‚Äôt cancel my flight. Why is it always so frustrating to deal with this type of issue with American Airlines? We were delayed 9hs!!! Can anyone please help!?
You fucking up horribly today @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Finding my bag (presumably later tonight in Providence) will be the next goal and a new adventure, but yeah, just landed in Boston. Thanks.
Gotta give props where props are due. @AmericanAir today‚Äôs travel was not only seamless and on time it was early and damned near perfect. üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ
@AmericanAir I did, that‚Äôs how this whole thing started. AAdvantage was very clear that they didn‚Äôt want to lift a finger.
@AmericanAir Angie at the Admirals Club customer service line just saved the day for my father. Thank you, Angie!!!!
@AmericanAir because you keep pushing my flight back I'm going to miss my connecting flight. Wtf are you going to do about it? We only have rain here in DC. #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir please train your employees on the importance of kindness and patience. what my aunt and I experienced today at dallas fort worth was embarrassing. a lady at gate b32 flat out harassed me; what the actual hell?
@AmericanAir He already did, and you have MANY unhappy customers on the flight whos luggage never made it. Families with all thier luggage missing. Not a good way to start the new year
@AmericanAir Ohhhh not alllll your customers deserve equal service, makes sense... Just saying i would‚Äôve paid $75 right there at the gate to upgrade to save my own time but that was not an option. I gotta pay insurance up front just in case? No thanks
Sitting on a plane with mechanical issues for an hour. Plane has been here all day and @AmericanAir could have prevented this disaster. Never flying them again
@AmericanAir is the worst airline ever! Simple flight schedule change and they want to charge a bunch of money! Will not fly again
@AmericanAir my daughter age 15 is traveling alone from China to Charlotte on AA, she is on business class but just be rejected into Dallas AA lounge because she is less than 18 and lounge serves alcohol. Is it true as flight also serves alcohol she is allowed to fly alone
@AmericanAir That is correct, we‚Äôve been aboard for more than 3 hours! What kind of joke is this response?
@AmericanAir We gate checked bags from Tampa to FSD w/layover in ORD as looking for volunteers. somewhere along the journey items were stolen out of my husbands suitcase including a pair of jeans with tags still attached. Not happy travelers when arrived home late last night!
@AmericanAir is the best in my opinion
@AmericanAir I did and they said the same thing. Said there was nothing they could do.
@AmericanAir I am devastated, and no one seems to have any ability to do anything. It is mind-blowing that there is not a single person at American Airlines who can rectify a terrible error made by their own agent. Yes, I have already sent a DM. #CustomerExperience #NIGHTMARE
After my next few flights with @AmericanAir I will never fly with them again. Horrible service, no integrity, and really and truly don‚Äôt care about the customer.
On AA Flight 2733 and we are sitting on a full flight as the maintenance crew works on the electrical system. Yep that means no air. You have to love @AmericanAir and their gross incompetence. How about you deplane people in lieu of letting them fry.
@AmericanAir Changing flights entirely is one thing. Making a round trip a one way instead should not require $. Sorry.
What a way to start a 9 hour trip, @AmericanAir. Sitting in the plane for the past 3 hours with no clue as to when we‚Äôll be able to leave. The crew is barely communicating with the passengers. ‚ÄúSome paperwork needs to be finalized‚Äù. That‚Äôs all we know. #nightmare
UPDATE: THERE ARE THREE DOGS ON MY FLIGHT! ALL ARE 13/10! THANK YOU @AmericanAir FOR THIS BLESSED FLIGHT!
@AmericanAir This is a call me thing, not a DM me thing
@AmericanAir why would I want to upgrade your services as a customer to have the opportunity to get to my destination the most efficient way for both of us? I would‚Äôve even paid you more, but not an entire ticket on top of my travels. Wasted money smh
Can you believe after meeting a woman on a flight to NYC (and again on the return flight to MSP) we will now be getting married 8/1/2020!! Thank you @AmericanAir for making it all happen. #AmericanAirlines #flirty #Dating #engagement #Aruba #honeymoon #love #BlessedAndGrateful
@AmericanAir Was I able to get on that plane as a customer? Nope. Unless I paid an additional $272... Did ANYONE get that seat? Nooooope. It‚Äôs flying empty rn.
Hey @AmericanAir do you offer Bereavement Flights for military spouse's?
Asked @AmericanAir gate agent if any first class upgrade options were available ... was told all full ... now riding out to runway ... I count 3 open first class seats that I can see. Perfect. üëçüèª
I would like to amend this statement: American Airlines is actually worse than the worst, if that‚Äôs possible. Hate you @AmericanAir
Our @AmericanAir connecting flight is going to be missed from Charlotte to NY (from Jackson‚Äî&gt;Charlotte) because ‚Äúthe plane turned around.‚Äù We were told we‚Äôre basically SOL. What great customer service.
Airline price gouging is real. Took two days for PTO to get approved for the new year and @AmericanAir bumps up the price almost 50%. No longer going on the trip. Happy new year to you too.
Like I said. @AmericanAir can go kick rocks. I‚Äôm this ‚Äî&gt;&lt;‚Äî close to renting a car and driving the 8 hours home. Will probably be faster.
@AmericanAir how seriously b/c I feel like I could have been called or DM'd back by now.....
I don‚Äôt care if @AmericanAir has $1 fares for the rest of eternity. I‚Äôm never flying them again unless I absolutely have to.
@AmericanAir I have DM'd my phone numb er... please call
. @AmericanAir Major #Kudos to Sarah on board flight #1017 from CHARLOTTE #CLT to Chicago #ORD tonight. Super friendly and efficient, and very in tune with the passengers. She gets service. Thanks Sarah.
Thanks @AmericanAir for getting my phone back to me! It is happy to be where it belongs.
@AmericanAir it‚Äôs unacceptable that you allow people who can‚Äôt fit in one seat to discomfort other paying customers. I am sitting on half a seat because the person next to me needs 1.5 seats. Where is my refund since I‚Äôm only getting half a seat?
Strive for better @AmericanAir üôÅ happy 2020.
I‚Äôve always felt safe being in the sky with you until now. I still carry the AA pen I received as a gift from an attendant when I was 5 &amp; gave up my vegetarian dinner to someone else on my flight. Immaculate respect for them and their duty. Disappointed in you @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir we‚Äôve been waiting inside the plane for two hours to depart. I‚Äôm traveling with a baby. No updates, no water, no nothing #happynewyear
Just left my passport on an @AmericanAir plane. If you find a passport for darren wardrobe let me know. It‚Äôs somewhere between Chicago and Palm Springs. Ta.
This is the absolute last time I fly with @AmericanAir. 4 delays on the same flight is beyond ridiculous, the fact we‚Äôve been waiting on this one jet for over 3 hours is so out of pocket.
@AmericanAir has to be THE worst airline with all of these crazy delays tonight
First Class flight attendant Brew on @AmericanAir 2615 CLT-RSW tonight may be best I‚Äôve ever had. Gave a genuine, heartfelt welcome and thanked Advantage members for their loyalty. Not from a corporate script; first time I‚Äôve heard anything like it.
@AmericanAir why oh why are you constantly late and delayed. Every single flight I booked with you last year was delayed and my very first of 2020 with you.. delayed. Frankly you suck at being on time.
@AmericanAir I then asked to speak with Tony‚Äôs supervisor nd he proceeded to tell me that he doesn‚Äôt have to give me that info. Very disappointed in the customer service!
Never flying @AmericanAir again! Flight delayed and they won‚Äôt allow upgrade to first class. What kind of mess is that! #airportchronicles
@AmericanAir all because I called due to not receiving an itinerary email from y‚Äôall. I received attitude and plain disrespect. Not to mention when I first called and put my name on the hold list when I received a call back a hour later the automatic machine hung up w/o transfer.
@AmericanAir which was the reason for me even asking about her sending my itinerary to my email. I stated can she not be rude and cut me off and she laughed. I asked can she make sure to keep me on the line so I can do the survey on her and she hung up.
@AmericanAir I paid extra to have a window seat and was moved after boarding to a center seat for my 6 hour flight. I‚Äôm pissed. How do I request a refund for my purchase?
After next week I‚Äôm never riding @AmericanAir again. Your representative Erica continuously cut me off when she asked me questions which led her to not following what I was saying. As I was asking a question to confirm something she stated ‚ÄúI just said that.‚Äù When she didn‚Äôt...
@AmericanAir .. very disappointing as always with your service. Forgot sunglasses In lounge and nobody in business class would help contact them.
@AmericanAir Hi , I am traveling with my wife back to India from honeymoon from JFK via AA 106. I wanted to know if we can be upgraded from main cabin to premium economy.
I have the miles to use, but please help me upgrade my red-eye flight home @AmericanAir ...confused why these precedures are not second nature to your staff and that this poor man‚Äôs medical care was dismissed &amp; delayed for too long. Currently his BP has dropped+nausea+chest pain
I‚Äôve been flying with you since I was 6 mo/old. If you cared for your loyal customers you would have given my pretzels/drink back after I had to use them &amp; my own personal 1st aid certifications to stabilize a barely conscious passenger across the aisle at my feet @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Damage is done. What's the email for consumer relations?
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs funny that Tony a ‚ÄúSupervisor‚Äù states the mistakes made by a team member is not his problem. I need to take it up it‚Äôs the airport. I didn‚Äôt buy my flight from the airport!!!
@AmericanAir just because I get to the airport early, doesn‚Äôt mean I want my bag on a early flight. Just stop...,
@AmericanAir Please arrange to have it sent back to my home as I am leaving my vacation tomorrow
@AmericanAir Total #fail today. Families separated. Class of service not honored. What were you thinking?
Awesome travel day. Started in Nashville before dawn. Boarded plane in Philadelphia for Providence (like a 34-min flight) around 12:30. Got to runway, first for departure. Computer glitch. Back to gate. Flight cancelled by @AmericanAir. Still in Philly trying to get up there.
@AmericanAir hi thanks for ride .I cant but ‚ù§ u guys ..delayed flight next flight upgraded.
[Insert pissed off tweet about @AmericanAir‚Äôs ‚Äúlack of overhead space‚Äù and forcing us to check our bags.]
@AmericanAir thank you for cancelling my flight and making me miss work and also not refunding me or even giving me a new flight
Just boarded an @AmericanAir flight with about 30 service men and women. Hoping they have not been called up due to the Iran escalation in the past 48 hours...üòîüôèüèªüá∫üá∏
this is my first time flying @AmericanAir in a long time and I know why I don‚Äôt fly them. The customer service was horrible and the flight attendants rude af!! This isn‚Äôt dicks restaurant it‚Äôs and airline and y‚Äôall should act like it!!!
@AmericanAir when are you going to add the option for carbon offsets during check out?
@AmericanAir Stuck on the tarmac at eagle airport. Supposed to leave a 3pm. Now 5:30. Totally mishandled by your staff. Very poor communication. Not sure what is happening. This is why I don‚Äôt fly American. Horrible customer service
@AmericanAir all Buffalo Bills fans must make it to the game in time tomorrow!!! (I‚Äôm not one one them. Wish I were.). Apparently, there are some fans stranded. Help them!!
How am I expected to embark on my long hike without my hiking gear? Boots, jacket, sleeping bag, snorkeling gear, sneakers, shorts, bowls. Where and with what $$ am I expected to buy this @AmericanAir
My Hawaii hiking adventure opportunity ruined. Thank YOU @AmericanAir flew out January 1st flight #3964. Never flying with #americanairlines again and all they have to say for it is I will be reimbursed? I‚Äôm a college student on a budget? ARE U FUCKING KIDDING ME? Eat or freeze
Flight 3964 to Kona, Hawaii and my hiking bag never made it out of Dallas, TX because they failed to scan @AmericanAir CANT SEEM TO FIND MY BAG? #AmericanAirlines #neveragain #worseexperience
The more I enjoy flying with @AmericanAir the more I dislike their strange policies. üò≥üò¢ They rather upgrade someone on the Upgrade list instead of accepting me on Standby Pos 1 with a paid F/D ticket üò≥. Got 17B offered - thanked and declined. Waiting 3h for my confirmed ‚úàÔ∏è.
I just booked a round trip flight to Charlotte $64 and it‚Äôs @AmericanAir ‚ù§Ô∏è
@AmericanAir Will do. He deserves it. Thank you!
So I‚Äôm not waiting for 10. üò© So @AmericanAir has THE WORST customer service. If you have an issue there is literally no one to provide service to the customer #dontflyamerican #worstcustomerservice #iwantmymoneyback
@AmericanAir You gotta love how American takes care of their passengers who fly strictly with them. Note my extreme sarcasm. It's quite a joke, to be honest. Pathetic.
I spent $490 for a round trip ticket from Philly to Minneapolis. I ended up needing only the one-way ticket so I wanted to change it to just a one-way ticket. @AmericanAir tells me that I owe $75 difference to do that, even though the one-way ticket is only $125 cheaper. UNREAL
Much gratitude to @AmericanAir for following up directly with me on an on-board pet allergy situation. Jana from customer service was extremely gracious and helpful and made me aware of current regulations.
I've never experienced such bad customer service than I have on this @AmericanAir flight ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
I have been averaging a grand a month flying lately. Settled on @AmericanAir for future flights. They lost a great customer today. Missed my alarm/flighty so AA customer service tells me my ~$500 flight is cancelled, no refund, and I can‚Äôt use the return flight...
@AmericanAir The team that called today and said we are looking at your bag and you‚Äôll have it in an hour? Or the team that called back 15 minutes later and said it‚Äôs at another airport on another island?
@AmericanAir Missed my $500 economy round trip flight You‚Äôd think I could at least pay for a one way ticket and take the return flight that I already paid for, right? WRONG The airline sells your tickets to someone else and doesn‚Äôt give you a refund! #FuckAmericaAir
this is for @AmericanAir you big fat white nasty smelling fat bitch why you delay my flight home to louisville by 3 hours for a failure on your part
Yo @AmericanAir is Trash dawg I‚Äôm tryna go back to base got charged extra 100 for my bag that was same weight it was when I left from Austin they didn‚Äôt charge me then
Hi @AmericanAir - my flight was delayed over the holiday and was rebooked but lost our prepaid extra legroom seats. Need help with refund of these costs. DM me please. Thanks!
that mood when @AmericanAir is the worst service i've ever flown on ü•∞ #justgivememybags
@AmericanAir I appreciate that. I wish I had been rebooked in this earliest option from the start, but it's fixed, and I am as happy as can be. Thank you.
Outstanding service from Kim last night on @AmericanAir flt 53. She was amazing as we sat on the plane for almost 3 hrs after departure time waiting for a FO. She deserves an award for managing the situation so well and keeping everyone happy and informed.
@AmericanAir I received an email telling me that I can have free Admiral's Club membership if I had your new credit card. I already have it. How do I get the club access?
I will never fly @AmericanAir again!! Last minute equipment change and I‚Äôm no longer traveling with my family or in the upgraded seat I paid for! (This is despite holding a boarding pass with the correct seats!) What terrible service too. A total fail.
@AmericanAir hi there. I have flight vouchers to use before Feb 2020. Does this mean I have to actually fly before this date or I have to make a booking before that date? Thanks
Dear @AmericanAir, Please pass on a huge, grateful shout out to crew member, Elizabeth on AA2 LAX-JFK today. The flight was pretty bumpy and she couldn‚Äôt have been kinder as I fell apart. She was amazing! Thank you!
@AmericanAir Can you do something about the music on the plane? üò¨
@AmericanAir All I ask is that your crew in Philadelphia airport is more helpful in the future. They did not care a single bit or give us any way to reroute our luggage. Not to mention them giving us false hope that everything would be okay, when they clearly did not care.
@AmericanAir What have you done with my senior father??? Dropped him off at the airport 10 hours ago. He has not gotten to his destination. You are giving me false information everytime I call. Is he lost??? I made all the arrangements for assisted service.
@AmericanAir That‚Äôs not helping at all. Your customer service refused to book me with a partnering flight. Or a 10 hour connection. #americanairlines is the WORST!
Im blessed enough the fee is no issue but I need to be able to hold her for my documented disability. It‚Äôs my understanding this is covered under the Air Carrier Access act. I am being discriminated against by @AmericanAir agents because of my disability. 3/
@AmericanAir Thank you AA (especially Pamela) for being very responsive to my submitted complaints. Nothing can change what has happened, but AA wants us to give them another chance to make things right. ü§û
@AmericanAir I am so disappointed in your airline. Every single flight for my trip to NY and back to KW has been delayed. Every. Single. One. None weather related. I will never ever fly with you again. I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre still in business.
Hey .@AmericanAir, pls tell me why I had to pay baggage fees TWICE for the same booking that gave us a 12 hr layover?! Must you nickle &amp; dime a family coming home from vacation? Poor form!
@AmericanAir spoke to their staff, wrote to the President of the company certified mail...guess what? They don‚Äôt care about their customers... What a surprise!
Who can help me? I have an emotional support animal who has traveled with me on the first 2 legs of my trip. Now, @AmericanAir special assistance phone rep + supervisor are denying my paperwork for my flight home. 1/
@AmericanAir now 7 days on vacation without my bag and going home tomorrow. Bag went to an airport I never flew to. You called today to say it was delivered. It wasn‚Äôt. 25 phone calls later and no answer. Absolute Incompetence. Executive platinum service indeed!
@AmericanAir And now delayed my flight so much I can‚Äôt make my connection. üò°
@AmericanAir it‚Äôs weird that a gate agent can‚Äôt change a ticket from clt to phl to open up a seat on a potential oversold flight to save you money and not issue a voucher.
Thanks @AmericanAir for ruining my entire weekend and not being at all helpful in rectifying any situation ever
@AmericanAir And as the gate agent was yelling at her for her kids moving, she turned around and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing the best I can,‚Äù and burst into tears. If this isn‚Äôt a situation that warrants a little extra compassion, I don‚Äôt know what is. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@AmericanAir Not your fault, and I understand communications have to be coordinated and anodyne. I‚Äôm just thinking of my grieving friend, who wanted to be able to get her children on the plane and get home, and how unnecessary this agent‚Äôs attitude was.
@AmericanAir I appreciate this, but it is almost verbatim the response she got in her email today. ‚ÄúOne of my responsibilities is to take customer feedback such as yours and record it in our system.‚Äù
@AmericanAir your Philly-LAX Planes suck. Are you ever going to update? Delayed so I could spend six hours getting my shoulder and elbow bruised. Have you ever tried taking one of your own flights? It‚Äôs PAIN.
Today I learned that @AmericanAir would rather a customer take a flight WITH THE FLU than waive a $200 fee to take a later flight. This is a major problem.
Is anyone else having trouble logging into the @AmericanAir app or is it just me? #AmericanAirlines
I dont understand how @AmericanAir can tell me that my dying grandmother is not a valid reason for cancellation of my flight. My flight isnt for another week. If it was one of them then this would be an unforeseen circumstance
@AmericanAir AA any update on this case for customer relations is appreciated. Case # 1-28911868689
Update: got to preboard, agent thanked me for "working with them as we had to make sure everything falls into place." I'm not sure what factors the existence of disability preboarding is contingent on that are unique to @AmericanAir (because Delta &amp; United announce preboard)...
@AmericanAir can go die in a hole. Every time I'm forced to fly this POS airline I'm delayed/transferred to a new fight plan.
My flight was cancelled earlier, they wouldn't book me with another airline where I would be on time.... And in the next part of this @AmericanAir saga, my flight they rebooked me for is DELAYED! LOL NEVERRRRR book with American Airlines people.
@AmericanAir Just BOOKED it from gate 37 to gate 26, only for the flight to be delayed. Your app sucks. Faulty gate information. #tooexpensive #racket #monopoly #AAcreditcardholder
I cannot believe @AmericanAir The customer service is horrible &amp; they show no compassion at all. They supposedly cannot help me at all. They are a billion dollar airline. Their employees and policies show that they do not care for people. Last time I'll be booking with them EVER
@AmericanAir your rep on the phone didn‚Äôt help and now call back times are over an hour. Why isn‚Äôt my tsa ore check showing up on my boarding pass????
the lady checking me in to my flight asked if i was travelling alone bc there was another "oriental" girl with a similar last name flying into the same city as me @AmericanAir lmao do better
@AmericanAir Hi! I went over my itinerary for a flight I‚Äôm taking Sunday and discovered my 7 year old son, 5 year old daughter and i have all been seated separately. Can you assist?
@AmericanAir been on the phone for days about my lost luggage &amp; tickets were over $1,000 ü•¥ need to handle those bags better
Been trying to find my lost luggage for daysüò© @AmericanAir I thought y‚Äôall was better than that. I would have just flown spirit ü•¥
@AmericanAir Hey, I want to book my baggage online but there is no possibilty for choosing an option. Wanna fly on 2020/07/21 from Washington to Miami
It takes me a longer time to get down the aisles using a cane. Some of my friends can't stand for long periods due to mobility issues or tachycardia. So are we just at the will of the gate agent and whether they believe in preboard, @AmericanAir
Thank you to the pilot(s) on @AmericanAir Flight 43 who did a great job of maneuvering through the turbulence from #Indy to #LA last night üëäüèºüôåüèº #LikeABoss
@AmericanAir when are you going to get back to me? #AmericanAirlines
Hey @AmericanAir ... been 35 minutes since we got off the plane in Orlando and no bags yet. Get your shit together.
@AmericanAir you have made it impossible to reach customer service, need an Angel at this point üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº
@AmericanAir As a matter of fact it is today. And they are now telling me there‚Äôs no way to fix it. And they show where I booked the seats and someone took them away from us. And he is a minor. Total incompetence. Never again on American Airlines. Worst service ever.
@AmericanAir canceled my flight, 7 calls and 4 hours later and still no rebooking. I was on the way to the airport when this all happened. Contact me ASAP, this customer experience is the WORST!
@AmericanAir on our Flight AA4864 CLT to TYS today Jan 3 I would like to compliment our flt attendant JODIAN for going the extra mile when the flt has been delayed by weather &amp; awaiting a pilot. She brought us snacks &amp; drinks, maintaining a very polite &amp; friendly attitude. üëç
Stranded in #phl on my way to #aha2020 for 5 hours for no good reason. @AmericanAir shoddy work strikes again.
I‚Äôve left Trinidad at 3:45 THIS MORNING!! @AmericanAir
What‚Äôs the point of having us stuck on the tarmac for well over an hour, no indication of when we‚Äôre leaving?! @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir There were no earlier flights. I booked a specific time for a reason. Really inconvenient.
TIL ... @AmericanAir will not, under any circumstances, let you book a flight path w/connection at CLT &lt; 35min. My connection for 3/24 to SAT is, in theory, 34m; that's the magic "no" number for confirmed flights. Thank you (as always) Carol from AA for being so kind about it.
@AmericanAir thanks for blocking me to not be able upgrade my Group boarding from 9 (last group) due to my wife buying thru Priceline, even though I paid $100 to upgrade my seats. Traveling with carryons. A refund would be nice.
@AmericanAir I've got a trip coming up this weekend and we have a long connection through Charlotte. Can you let me know if my ticket qualifies me and a guest to access the Admirals Club please?
@AmericanAir any update on flight 2671 PHX to SAN?
@AmericanAir is the worse airline ever. Delay my family for 24 hours. Mess up the next flight and delay that. Will not take any responsibility and only lie!! #neverflywiththese #airlinecomplaints #virginforever #BAforever #soupset #customerservice #awfulservice #THEYDONOTCARE
@AmericanAir Will do. Rebooked for tomorrow.
Shout out to the incredibly kind and accommodating flight crew of @AmericanAir flight 1423 from LAX to BOS today!
@AmericanAir To me this is unacceptable. We were not treated as valued customers. Just told policy over and over again.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve had to cancel work trips because of AA delays or rearrange meetings because of delays. 1 min late and AA is not flexible at all. There were 10-15 people that got stuck with us. The agent closed the door on a girl waiting for her elderly mother to get to the gate.
@AmericanAir Understood. We were at the airport almost 2 hours early. There wasn‚Äôt enough agents at the priority counter to get people through in time. Bags were still being loaded on the plane when we got to the gate. I expected more from AA. Then to be stuck at Aus for 16 hrs was ridiculous
Honestly at this fucking point after getting ALL MY FUCKING FLIGHTS CHANGED and literally having no ideas what gates I‚Äôm at in the biggest airports (PLURAL) in America IM NEVER FLYING WITH @AmericanAir ever fucking again.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôd like to give a shout out to Ms Brenda Amos, CS agent on the EXP phone line. She went the extra mile last night to figure a workaround in the system to get me flights I wanted. Well done and thank you Brenda!!
Can anyone else tel why the fuck @AmericanAir has peopblems that go down on planes that the pilots find and not maintenance AKA A FUCKING FLAT TIRE
@AmericanAir looks like an oxygen bottle cap is gonna make me miss 713 to MIAüò°üò°. Trying to get to STX today. #help
Cal someone people tell me how EVERY SINGLE flight I‚Äôve ever taken with @AmericanAir has been atleast 30mins late
@AmericanAir really needs to change their stroller policy with the weigh limit. Traveling with children is stressful enough &amp; to add on that only umbrella strollers are permitted to gate check is absurd.
Shoutout to @AmericanAir for not transferring our bags from a flight they cancelled and said they ‚Äúwould be fine‚Äù. And then when we finally get them to ship them to London, they didn‚Äôt even know the shipping company they handed them off to. What a great way to run an airline!
@AmericanAir AAflight attendant told me that I need to be more prepared. I asked for milk since the baby woke up unexpectedly. What am I suppose to do TSA doesn't let us take milk past security and between flights I didn't have time.
@AmericanAir Help! I left my MacBook in it‚Äôs case, on flight 4648 from PWM-CLT-EYW, on 12-30-2019!
@AmericanAir how do I get someone actually willing to help with an issue??
Free drinks as in alcoholic beverages lol. If you travel @AmericanAir often, get Admirals Club access. #ShamelessPlug
@AmericanAir failing me! Due to a broken seat in business class forced to fly coach after purchasing a business class tix separating me from my wife! Unacceptable!!!
@AmericanAir Further cementing your spot as my least favorite airline. Currently my flight which has been delayed until 3pm (as informed by the gate agent) is still reading as ‚Äúdeparted‚Äù for some reason. When I asked the gate agent why, she said ‚Äúoh, that thing is never right...‚Äù
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm direct messaging. I‚Äôm not so sure that many aren‚Äôt abusing the system.
@AmericanAir An apology without a plan for improvement is not super helpful...
@AmericanAir oh American, how you disappoint. Flt delayed Mon phl-lex now delayed today lex-phl. Good work. Ugh
@AmericanAir I still have yet to her a response from American airline. Worst customer service! From flight delays to rude customer service agents. Icing of the cake even ruder flight attendants to not ask you if you would like a beverage. Worst airline! Please avoid!
@AmericanAir if y‚Äôall could get your stuff together and actually send our luggage with us on the plane, that‚Äôd be great. It‚Äôs very cold in Budapest without a jacket. Thanks.
@AmericanAir hi do you guys help with flight changes via Twitter? Can‚Äôt reach the number from my location
@AmericanAir people are still boarding after me (non black) with bags the same size as mine. Complete bullshit!
@AmericanAir literally as I was going to give you guys a compliment for this trip, a racist ass counter person sought me out of everyone before &amp; after me &amp; only made me check my bag, when I just got off a connecting flight with the same bag!
.@AmericanAir "Award processing fee" of $75? This crap is why people hate airlines.
@AmericanAir Oh and as it turned out there were 4 first class seats available.
@AmericanAir Oh and guess what it says on my boarding pass- exit row.
Thank you @AmericanAir for letting us know we left a bag at LAX, b/c after a week traveling w/ 3 kids to 2 diff cities w/ at least 5 bags + a car seat, we had no idea we lost it. Lol. This is also why I couldn't find any pants for Beefcake Jake to wear. #3kids #familytravel
@AmericanAir I think it is really crappy that because the Advantage card is in my husbands name I can‚Äôt use the benefits. Even though we BOTH pay for this card!
Woke up at 4:30am for my flight at 8 and my flight got delayed til 2pm thanks @AmericanAir
Didn't get her name but an @AmericanAir angel seemed to appear out of nowhere right as we needed check in help. #sothankful #lga #holidaytravel #americanairlines
@AmericanAir I had asked baggage team in Cozumel and they said that there was nothing that they could do. Thank you, again.
Iceberg flight ü•∂@AmericanAir AA586 to Louisville
Amazes me how 100% of the time my @AmericanAir flights are cancelled or delayed
@AmericanAir I will be out of town until Jan 20 for work. Can I speak with the baggage team at my home airport in Vegas? Thank you!
@AmericanAir you are the worst with customer service! Not friendly at all. I talked with 2 supervisors one on the phone and one in person both not helpful. The customer service representative was rude and aggorant. Avoid this airline at all cost if you can!
Hi there @AmericanAir if my flight was rescheduled by 2 hours, am I allowed to change it w/o a fee? What if it‚Äôs a basic economy ticket? Thanks!
Hey @AmericanAir my bags didn‚Äôt make my flight to Tampa but they got on the next one. Keep checking status and it says they‚Äôre in Tampa but not when/if they‚Äôre delivered. I‚Äôm with my mom in the hospital and haven‚Äôt changed clothes in three days. Help!
My second flight just got cancelled so now I‚Äôm stuck at the airport til 4. Thanks @AmericanAir
Thanks to @AmericanAir I am sitting on my honeymoon without any luggage. Worst experience ever
@AmericanAir The agent I had been emailing with phoned me and we discussed the situation at length, and she suggested looking into whether our credit card provides trip insurance. Although I'm not happy about the misinformation at PHF, I really appreciate your reaching out to me. Means a lot!
@AmericanAir It was at check in, on phone they gave me a connection flight, which would of missed my da, she checked and said we have a non stop in 40 min leaves, made several calls and she got it done, a blessing, just made it. record locator QQPTGM please give her my best, it was about 5 pm
@AmericanAir I did but customer service was rude and you could show some sympathy for a young girl that wanted to spend time with her team. There are always exceptions to the rule #grinch #nocompassion.
@AmericanAir hello! how much you guys charge for extra bags for internacional flights? and how many pounds? thank you
@AmericanAir Hi! I have some luggage related questions. Just sent a DM :)
@AmericanAir , how do you treat the elderly so bad, my mom took a flight on Dec 9 from NY to NC, she was transferred to 3 different planes, they lost her luggage, none of the airline personnel would assist or help her. Shame on you guys
How can @AmericanAir change my flight a week before I take off? I have friends meeting me at the airport and now I leave when they arrive
@AmericanAir Is there anyone at Miami that can help?
I will not be flying with @AmericanAir again. The customer service supervisor Mr. Rivers told me he was not willing to help me change my flight and then proceeded to send my call to the end of call survey in my mid sentence. This was after he was rude for 8 mins.
@AmericanAir If the price is right I'm willing to take a last minute flight from STL to BOS leaving on the 3rd and returning the 5th of January if you want to fill some empty seats.
Hey @AmericanAir -- my best friend flew to DCA from Rochester last night, with her four children, ages 6, 5, 3, and 1. She had been visiting her mom for Christmas after her dad's death. The gate agent was terrible to her and made a difficult trip so much harder.
@AmericanAir They aren‚Äôt free! I wanted to sit by my husband and you wanted me to pay for that. It‚Äôs literally a joke.
@AmericanAir can someone help our pilot on AA1089 with the mechanic paperwork? Sad
@AmericanAir Booked a trip yesterday and found a better price today, cancelled my original trip and I was already putting passenger info for new flight when it redirected me to find a new flight. And these were more expensive and it was same flight I was just about to book.
@AmericanAir Even after 14 hrs , there is no visible action . We are going to buy necessary items worth $ 1000 and would claim from American airline
@AmericanAir my February flights keep going down in price and I‚Äôm stuck with the much higher ones??Wow, amazing way to get repeat business!!üò°#neveragain üëéüèº
@AmericanAir this mechanical issue in Miami on AA1089 might cost me my yacht trip. Not a good reflection on your Brand.
@AmericanAir Why is customer service at AA so bad?
Another year, another @AmericanAir delay. Missed my connection last night in Phoenix because of one and this morning again to dallas was delayed. I just got my morning pt in with a mini-ruck run around fort worth, last to board with 2mins to spare. Thanks american
@AmericanAir thanks to the gate agents Tinna Shoemaker and Sheri Smith in San Antonio for getting us to our final destination.
I think someone needs a new job this year @AmericanAir #2020
Hey @AmericanAir flight attendent your not making it any better for us by complaining about your passengers who want water and have been sitting on a flight without AC for over an hour
@AmericanAir Traveled from DCA‚Äî&gt;OAK. My bag was lost during the journey. Was told it would be on the next flight to OAK &amp; come pick it up 5 hours later. I come back to OAK 5 hours later, still not there. I opt to get it delivered. Was not delivered last night. I need that bag for work today!
Very early on in 2020 but already 2/2 for upgrades with @AmericanAir, Hope the trend continues! #eplife
@AmericanAir flying a regional carrier, not a good experience so far. Row purchased is not the exit row despite paying for such &amp; no complimentary 500 mile upgrade although seats are available. Flight 5878 by Mesa Airlines. Pls coordinate better for our return trip.
@AmericanAir Right, which is why this is so crappy especially as a longtime Plat / Exec Plat customer with almost half a million lifetime actual miles flown on AA. Would rather be spending that money on my honeymoon
Thank you @AmericanAir for showing veterans so much love and respect.
What is going on @AmericanAir we‚Äôve been boarded for an hour already #flightdelays
@AmericanAir Can you please advise how my brother should reach out? He is not on Twitter. But I think he would like to have a discussion with someone.
I will be posting all my evidence to show that this was a screw up by the travel folks waiting for AA to own up I‚Äôll be back in Chicago Saturday night and will post then @AmericanAir #AmericanTeam
Never EVER buy the insurance when getting a flight through @AmericanAir because it‚Äôs an absolutely ridiculous process and impossible to use, pointless money spent. And they‚Äôre rude. Why does American make everything so difficult?
Nothing better than buying 2 @AmericanAir tickets from PHX to OGG 2 weeks ago, and now today 9 days before the flight they‚Äôre $80 apiece cheaper. Thanks guys.
@AmericanAir Just landed Probably going to miss my 1116 aa flight clt-PHX
@AmericanAir I finally got new flights. But with no thanks to American Airlines. They are not taking any responsibility even though I had ticket reservation #s and my names listed on the reservation. No good excuse yet as to why these original tix were cancelled for us.
@AmericanAir I understand. We only have one large device in our family. So I will be watching entertainment on my tiny phone without the screens.
@AmericanAir Will do. I certainly have NOT experienced any appreciation of my loyalty thus far.
The customer service around here is extremely frustrating... I‚Äôve been trying for weeks to get in touch with @AmericanAir about my flight issues. The online refund page is never working &amp; customer service won‚Äôt help me. This is ridiculous! I‚Äôm out almost $400 that i shouldn‚Äôt be.
@AmericanAir Thanks. I used the link you provided. Perhaps if you make the situation right I would consider flight with you guys again. We‚Äôll see what kind of support we get.
Wow! Wonderful job @AmericanAir flight crew. Our AA Flight 1040 is one hour and 15 minutes ahead of schedule! üëåüèΩüëåüèΩüëåüèΩ I‚Äôm one happy #AAdvantage member!
We just traveled with 2 small children. We were incredibly frustrated by the fact that even though we purchased a ticket for our 12 month old, we were still asked to wait to board with Group 5. @AmericanAir ticketed children under 2 should be able to pre-board!!!
@AmericanAir I had a real problem on 12/22 and a horrible experience with platinum status. How do I get American to respond to my issue and actually provide customer service? At this point I don‚Äôt ever want to fly AA again.
@AmericanAir Part 2..eventually put on standby, which didn‚Äôt happen, yet bags were sent. No bags and stranded in st Croix, headed back to airport at 5am to ensure check in. Made it the flight, yet still no bags. Your inner crew at STX are competent and helpful, as opposed to check in staff
@AmericanAir i actually just got a refund. good for me.
@AmericanAir #Charlotte airport men‚Äôs room attendant is a shining example of being proud of your work. No matter what it is. He is an amazing guy. Gate A5 at 10:00 am.
@AmericanAir 12/31 Galeao/Brazil 1pm, my LATAM flight it 7pm. Nonone at American's booth. Info desk gives me local American's phone, Tried for 3 hrs no answer. I'm told American agent only arrives at the airport 2 hrs prior to their scheduled flight. I can't wait otherwise I'll miss my flight
@AmericanAir your staff at St. Croix check in is abysmal. Signs say to check with agent if it‚Äôs 90 minutes to departure. We did and were told to go back in line (90 minutes out). By the time we reached the counter, the flight was closed, they couldn‚Äôt care less. Rude and blas√©
@AmericanAir 12/20- call. Told I need to go back to airport to fill-out a form that I can't do it over the phone. Remember I'm 2 hrs from Rio's airport. So I asked how long I have to retrieve bag. I'm told 21 days so I decide to claim my bag prior to my flight back on 12/31
@AmericanAir ...decide to call when get home 12/19 call Rep can't help "because her manager is not in". Asked to call next day (couldn't she access info in her PC/system?!).
@AmericanAir American Airlines flight LA6174 from JFK to Galeao (Rio-Brazil) schedule to take off 9:55pm is 5 hours delayed (not due to weather!) 12/19 -arrival in Brazil-RJ, 5 hours after original arrival time! Can't see my luggage, about to miss my very expensive transportation so ...
Apparently checking in online doesn‚Äôt count @AmericanAir Just had to rebook because I was too late to ‚Äòcheck in‚Äô when I went to print my boarding pass at the kiosk.
@AmericanAir My apologies, I meant 10:20 central time. Can they still make that one?
@AmericanAir, on another note, the personnel in the "customer service" office laughed at a traveller from China visiting America for the first time, as she struggled to express her frustrations with her luggage that AA handlers broke. What kind of culture is AA building?
@AmericanAir can you help? I am having issues choosing seats on an upcoming flight - it has said "check again later" since I booked...can choose for return leg, just not outward
@AmericanAir K, thank you for checking.
@AmericanAir How do i cancel the report if i found them???
@AmericanAir you shouldn‚Äôt have a no smoking sign if you can‚Äôt smoke to begin with. Quit being a tease.
@AmericanAir calling bullshit on you and other airlines. Forcing people to pay for seat selection in economy is a SCAM. If couples/families are booking together and seats together are available they should be given those seats. Instead you shake flyers down for $$. #moneygrab
American Airlines is removing all of the screens from their seat backs on domestic flights. Only those paying enough to travel overseas will be able to watch TV or any entertainment on the back of the seat in front of them. Prices go up, options go down. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir, MCO to DCA on 1 Jan, AA luggage handlers broke our baby stroller. Went to your "customer service" desk in DCA, AA employees laughed at our request for help. The AA claims agent on the phone provided no direction, and actually said "I don't want to hear it." Why?
@AmericanAir What is the status of flight 1984 to Dallas? My wife and her classmates have a connecting flight to McAllen at 9:20 central time.
@AmericanAir Why are you taking the TV screens out of your seat backs? That was the best part of yh flight for my six-yr-old. I‚Äôm switching my miles and my travel plans to Delta. You charge the same amount but take away the options onboard the flight? Ridiculous.
I rarely let things bother me nowadays, but the service I received on my @AmericanAir flight and their resolution to my complaint makes me sick
@AmericanAir Do you know the status of flight 1984 to Dallas?
@AmericanAir y‚Äôall flight attendant bout to get molly whopped
@AmericanAir if you have Elite status - but fly ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù to Europe do you still get 1 free bag or no?
@AmericanAir Two weeks, no tweets, no emails, no phone call. So the "chance to impress" me is just that I need to spend my money again and hope you do a good job?
@AmericanAir It was located with TSA in Miami. We advised the person with whom we checked it that it contained non-spillable batteries, approved for travel by TSA, so not sure what happened. How can I apply for a refund of baggage fee?
@AmericanAir I did. They said, ‚ÄúOur airport agents should make every effort to provide our customers with correct information and I'm sorry we didn't do so.‚Äù They also said AA has a limited # of vouchers. The problem remains: you should keep your agent‚Äôs word, and treat all customers equally.
Bad news: @AmericanAir delayed our plane for ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù problems which means we lost a day and I get to spend 13 hours of my birthday on a plane. Good news: those hours are earned back so my birthday is technically 37 hours this year.
@AmericanAir 4 gate changes so far. 3378 going out of ? Agents say b-22 , board says b-4
@AmericanAir still showing 8:30 am departure and yet not boarding and no text or info on status - rule number one - communicate with your customers ...
@AmericanAir I lost my purse on a flight in first class cabin. I filled out the report but I don‚Äôt understand why my item wasn‚Äôt recovered yet. I have important documents in my purse. I know this is my fault but I‚Äôm hoping that it was turned in by an employee
@AmericanAir What bothers me is a) your agent at PHF said it would be covered, and b) you DID cover transportation (via cab) for other passengers. Standing behind your agents‚Äô word, and treating people equally, are important. (I would be fine if you limited reimbursement to same as cab fare.)
Big thanks to Janice at DCA @AmericanAir luggage help desk for locating and delivering our equipment bag to the hotel before today‚Äôs game! #Madants #AthleticTrainers
Thank you @AmericanAir for the complimentary upgrade to first class on the flight from Kansas City to Washington DC this morning. What a special way to start my R&amp;R from Afghanistan with my wife.
@AmericanAir If you care about your travelers, provide accurate information instead of blowing smoke up their asses. I should be surprised, but I am not.
@AmericanAir what‚Äôs the hold up on status on flight 1604 - board shows new departure at 8:30 am but no one at ticket counter believes it‚Äî- please communicate with us with facts not just placate your passengers .
NEVERRR flying @AmericanAir again. EVER. Flight #3835 made us board, check all of our luggage, wait, deplane, and then they wouldn't rebook my flight with another airline so I could make my connecting flight. Do NOT book with them.
I got the next destination Shanghai, China, but my luggage has not left Dalas. Fuuuuuuck. Yes I know that there was no time for transfer flight, it took 40min. Newark &gt; Dalas &gt; Shanghai. cc @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir came up fewer than 180 miles short to keep Platinum for 2020. Is there a 1 time exception u might give since I was so close? I even had a 12/31 flight that would have put me over the top but I was unable 2 make the flight. As a loyal flyer, I would be super grateful!
Thanks for the upgrade @AmericanAir ü§òüèª
@AmericanAir Help. I'm getting an error message when trying to book my flight to Iran.
@AmericanAir Especially when it isn‚Äôt your fault.
@AmericanAir I paid for 1st class on my flight. On 2nd leg I get bumped to economy - how? The next day (another set of flights) I‚Äôm ask to give up my seat for credit I said yes let me get my passport. When I came back (30secs later) they are talking to someone else and gave it to him...
@AmericanAir - is there a number at the CLT airport I can call for lost &amp; found?
Pray and be vigilant for all Americans around the world on planes. FAA needs to assure the public that ppl working within air travel are not being radicalized-are you listening @AmericanAir ?
@AmericanAir Interesting. My best friend was deboarded off of that plane and rebooked on another flight, so...not sure how the plane is still away from the gate since 4:59am and she is sitting inside the airport.
@AmericanAir You definitely will! I‚Äôll be updating our tickets to first class again soon based on the great experience we had these last two weeks of travel!
I always had a good experience with @AmericanAir however, today the employees were being a asshole. They didn‚Äôt help for anything. We finna miss our flight because the employees had an attitude and gave us the wrong directions. NEVER AGAIN.
@AmericanAir so you have a system failure that literally will not allow flight in rain? Is that even possible? Come on man...
@AmericanAir you have to pay a large sum to pick your seats but at least they give you free headphones
@AmericanAir I want to give a shout out to one of your flight attendants I didn‚Äôt catch his name but he had a beard, and worked in the first class section on the 641 am flight from HHSC to Charlotte. Guy was great, and went above and beyond to make sure my short flight was great
@AmericanAir Well to start, I said good morning to your staff at the podium, along with the flight attendants. Both times ignored, they were too concerned about chatting instead of greeting passengers as we entered to plane. Very unprofessional.
@AmericanAir line hasn‚Äôt moved. they are saying systems are down. will they hold the flight?
And the customer service sucks on @AmericanAir No acknowledges you at all.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm perplexed how you can try and put a story out like this but still extort money from customers with seat upgrades when no other seats are available. #areyouthathardup #gradezerooncustomerservice
First tweet in 4 years and this is why‚Äî @AmericanAir WHERE TF IS MY LUGGAGE?! BEEN 60 HOURS AND EACH TIME I CALL YOUR BAGGAGE CALL CENTER YOUR REPS TELL ME SOMETHING DIFFERENT #AmericanAirlines #lostluggage #shootmee
Gave @AmericanAir 4 opportunities to prove that customer service is important. They failed miserably. Don‚Äôt close the gate in your customers face!
@AmericanAir less than 2 hours until take off and no agents at ticket counter in Oakland. What time does the counter open?
@AmericanAir I swear I had no idea I was buying the "fu" ticket.
@AmericanAir thanks for the six hour delay and btw just got my bags n my shit broken but say what
@AmericanAir Wow. So sit and suffer. Cool.
@AmericanAir horrible first experience with this airline, treat your customers with respect #customerexperience
Many many thanks @AmericanAir for the ride to, and from Buenos Aires this week! Happy New Year Friends!
@AmericanAir Can I transfer to another flight or is the ticket garbage?
@AmericanAir Why cant I buy an upgrade? Why are certain groups prohibited from that? Why is charging the difference such a complicated task?
@AmericanAir Tried that already. Less than helpful. No one has the guts to do anything. Guess I‚Äôll fly Delta from now on. Thanks for nothing.
When @AmericanAir discriminates you at the airport because U are travelling with your support dog &amp; they don‚Äôt want to deal with it.Then customers service ignores the seriousness of the complaint since October. #disgusting #discrimination #takeyourcustomerseriously #supportdog
.@AmericanAir wish someone would respond to my previous tweet. Your poor customer service is costing you 5 customers. #confirmmyseats
@AmericanAir Messaged. Flight changed at desk. Computer bag ruined. Suitcase wet. Clothes inside are wet. I have precious little time with my nephew and you stole that time from me. #fail
@AmericanAir AA rebooked them, but they will have spent close to 13 hours in the airport by the time they come home. AA already "helped" in the only way the company was willing. I really can not believe how poorly that was handled. In 15 years of business travel I have never seen this.
@AmericanAir makes it so hard to change your password. üôÑ
@AmericanAir the agent at E8 at MIA is being extremely rude to a passenger that missed their flight and is speaking very loudly for the whole gate to hear. This is not very good customer service and frankly, not nice at all. Way too early for this.
@AmericanAir currently juggling computer that cannot go back in wet bag while in line.
@AmericanAir wow! Arrived over an hour early for flight 1746 and had the doors closed while 3 of our 5 stood at the doors and the other 2 were less than 10 seconds away. Gate agent Yvonne knew we were seconds away and closed it anyway. It was a TSA nightmare but you made it worse
@AmericanAir now I‚Äôm gonna miss my connector. I won‚Äôt be able to see my nephew? #fail
@AmericanAir CRW to Charlotte. Exit row. Drop of water from window. Alert staff. Condensation? No worries
.@AmericanAir my brother was supposed to be on a flight home last night, and you pulled their pilots off their flight after they boarded. Then delayed their flight 667 5 times, and then canceled it. They get home 15 hours later now and all you provided was a $12 meal voucher.
12 hours late and downgraded seats on the new flight. @AmericanAir thinks we will do business with them again and a #voucher fixes that? Do their customer service people smoke crack?
6 hour flight on @AmericanAir and no power outlets? #really? It‚Äôs 2020!
Just got sick on an international @AmericanAir flight and was pretty shocked at the service of the flight crew. Would love to talk to someone about my experience.
@AmericanAir I'm never flying your piece of shit airline again
Finally to our destination 12 hours past schedule. Very little help from @AmericanAir the whole way. I will NEVER use this airline again. #awful #badservice #worstairline
Leave it to @AmericanAir to screw up our flights. I never have trouble on other airlines. Booked 2 seats (months ago) side by side with my son (minor). At some point AA split us up and not can‚Äôt fix it? AND blame ME because I didn‚Äôt book direct with them? WTH?
So now we can pay for wifi and then get reimbursed. So nice. Let's pay for the flight and then pay for the entertainment that we paid for already and then try and get reimbursed. Good job @AmericanAir #Americanairlines. #TrashPlanes
@AmericanAir Thank you!! They deserve it!
.@AmericanAir Your #ILM crew is fantastic! Both Laurie and Wendy went above &amp; beyond to provide me with a SUPERIOR experience this morning. Haven‚Äôt flown American in a while and I am EXTREMELY pleased. Your entire ILM crew is the epitome of southern hospitality at its best!
@AmericanAir your kiosks don‚Äôt work if passengers booked through a third party carrier. We have to wait in an hour long line at CDG just to check our bags and might miss our flight home because of it.
@AmericanAir Just to confirm, leaving Philadelphia at 3:40pm?
@AmericanAir Well, I guess you should be ü§î, but at the end we made it home safely ‚Äî and the kids enjoyed the extra two days of adventures...
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been flying for 30 yrs and AA is the only airline who arbitrarily assign seats. You will reassign for a fee.. how irresponsible and dishonest. You should take a lesson from SouthWest airlines
@AmericanAir I bought a ticket and it was for economy. I would have had to pay extra to be in the ‚Äúmain cabin‚Äù so I am wondering, if I am not in the main cabin, where will I be???
@AmericanAir Currently on Flight AA 851 and it‚Äôs super delayed (almost 2 hours). My connecting flight will be missed. What should I do?
@AmericanAir That is a ridiculous response.
@AmericanAir breaking up groups, couples and everything in its path to require a fee in order to allow the groups and or couple to have seats next to each other
@AmericanAir refund me this shit terrible
.@AmericanAir GET US OFF THIS PLANE. What in the hell are you doing? Flight 245 at LAX is in purgatory. Your airline is abysmal. Full stop.
@AmericanAir I KNEW you couldn't successfully get me roundtrip without screwing it up. Flight #245 has been sitting on the tarmac at LAX for almost an hour. You ARE officially America's worst airline. ONE HOUR. #americanairlinessucks
the worst airline award goes to @AmericanAir üèÜ
@AmericanAir Also, thanks for the hotel voucher that isn't valid and food vouchers we can't use. A+ service morons. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir customer service is a joke. Promised e-vouchers for a returned flight that we've had in the past and still haven't applied it. They expire in June and we tried to book and still can't use them. Have confirmation numbers and everything. Been hung up on 4 times trying-
@AmericanAir Every time lately. Every segment of every trip. You've got to get it together.
@AmericanAir She then walked down the jetway and halfway down the aisle and told me I had to check my bag. I put it in the overhead in one motion where it fit easily. She refused to allow me to carry it on. If I argued, I risked getting thrown off the plane.
@AmericanAir I was bullied by the gate agent for AA #1937 CLT to BOS. She pulled my wife‚Äôs carry on bag when it clearly fit in the overhead. I waited and asked her to let it through but the agent refused.
@AmericanAir cancels a 5:30am flight at 1 in the morning. Now will miss important meeting and have to pay $100 fee for changing rides. Thanks American, really looking out for customers
@AmericanAir My flight from Boston to Casablanca on Dec 26 was canceled by the airline at the last minute, and I had to book another flight to go there. What is the best way to get reimbursement/compensation for this?
Im a mother flying alone with a baby on @AmericanAir I ask if I can board early&amp;get yelled at. Not 1 attendant offers to help me with my carry on as I struggle to put it in the over head while holding an 11MO. Thanks for the AMAZING experience flying with my son for the 1st time!
@AmericanAir Yes, I know that, my daughter is there live getting updates which are probably more accurate than the system. Curious to know what she is supposed to do once she lands in Phoenix with connection flights to Boston or PVD missed. #expectations
@AmericanAir Oh cool, but that‚Äôs totally not what happened. How is your team going to fix that?
Get me the hell out of Phoenix @AmericanAir. This layover is short but damn this airport is Fug.
I might have left my AirPods on a flight @AmericanAir ! What can i do?
@AmericanAir How do you have multiple flights to the NY area without crews? #terrible #youhavelostacustomer
@AmericanAir Not just added wait time but several complete misdirections that had us traipsing back and forth between baggage claim terminals several times and multiple rude staff. üôÑ
@AmericanAir Just need better planning on AA‚Äôs part. I have no idea if she will be flying into Boston or Providence and what time tomorrow as there still question which connection she will in Phoenix, if any.
@AmericanAir Hey, s*#t happens. I understand! ‚úàÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@AmericanAir plane has been here in PHX but you can‚Äôt find a crew????? 6 hour delay with no other options offered. Flight 1439 to Newark #notgreat
We literally have been waiting for our baggage for a full hour now @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir chem trails are real sexy
@AmericanAir y‚Äôall are just messing with me now. Delaying me to and from MA. Working in aviation it scares me that every aircraft of yours I get on has issues
@AmericanAir is the literal worst. If I have another choice I will never fly with them again üò´
@AmericanAir i have a surprise for you guys on April 10th at 11:33am
All I want from @AmericanAir is two pilots to fly me home
@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac for 90 min in Kona due to mechanical errors. One and then another. High likelihood to miss connecting flight from DFW to LGA after this 7 hour flight. #travel #airlines #vacation
@AmericanAir As in, I sat in the seat? That‚Äôs it. I paid to be seated further up in the plane. No extra leg room. And I ended up in a sauna. It‚Äôs not a big thing but then neither is a refund.
Every time I fly @AmericanAir I reminded why I don‚Äôt like to flying with this airline .. the worst! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@AmericanAir Imma need your dealer in the vegan honey mustard seasoned pretzels ü•® because they are sooooooo good. ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§
2020 not off 2 a good start. Was headed to NYC. Due 2 delays I wld not hv gotten there until after midnight. However, I‚Äôve learned after 37 years of cust svc wk 2 not blame the agent. Not their fault. All my miles were refunded. @AmericanAir u r the best!
@AmericanAir flight 6044 delayed now...any details on the status of this delay?
@AmericanAir Maybe you should take a look at better scheduling of your flight crews. We‚Äôre waiting for the pilot. Not the first time.
@AmericanAir My 18 yr old child missed her connection in Dallas when you shut the door in her face. No branded hotel will take her in because she is ONLY 18. My DMs are open. FIX THIS BEFORE SHE GETS HURT
Just flew home from DFW on @AmericanAir we packed in carrier ons and were made to check our bags ...now we wait. Could‚Äôve already been home in bed üò≥
Thanks to Kim Morris, @AmericanAir, and the #AAdvantageProgram for an extraordinary act of generosity, demonstrating that loyalty is indeed a two-way street, and for that, we look forward to years of mutually prosperous global travel. Best wishes to all for a successful #2020!
@AmericanAir To late we had to cancel our trip. We had plans in Pittsburgh for tonight We also had to cancel our hotel for tonight without getting a refund because it was less than 24 hours due to the AmericanAirlines mechanical delay. Your employees at no time were helpful today Disappointed
Honestly i'm thinking I should've just insisted that my driver go fuck off for a few hours and then I would pick my bags up once they got off the later flight after the clusterfuck of getting to the second flight of my day. I just want my shit, @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Pm sent. My mistake- not air brake flap, was the middle small flap port side. All flaps down, middle flap had movement while the two large flaps were stationary.
@AmericanAir Thank you for totally messing up our plan for vacation
Looking for my turtle necklace I think I lost on one of your planes to Kona yesterday, @AmericanAir. Small glass pendant on a black string. Sentimental and pretty. Is there anyone I can ask about a lost and found?
@AmericanAir thank you for having such great people on your team. Alicia M from PHX employee 777143,literally made my night by going the extra mile to help me and answer all of my questions üëçüèª
@AmericanAir Appreciate anything you can do. Holding out hope for my very sad little boy. Thanks.
Hey @AmericanAir, big thank you to your economy cabin crew (Frank and Debbie) on AA341 to LAX today - they were great.
@AmericanAir Just DMed. Thanks for the response.
I will NEVER fucking fly @AmericanAir again...
@AmericanAir any updates on flight 2713
@AmericanAir if this was not the 1st or even 20th time I had experienced an unreasonable delay, I might not be so pissed. Now at DFW trying to get home with my husband, who has a heart condition and has a doctor appointment tomorrow. Sleep well, you heartless corporate bully.
@AmericanAir The LGA to PIT flight we were booked on was delayed for 9 hours before being cancelled. A handful of passengers found another flight to PIT that we scrambled onto. THIS PLANE WAS NEARLY EMPTY. All of the passengers from the original flight could have made it home. Shame on you.
@AmericanAir also please help me understand your thought process of boarding a plane when the first officers flight doesn‚Äôt arrive for almost an hour after scheduled departure time. What a cluster and pure incompetence.
@AmericanAir please let me change my flightü•∫
Between the first delay and the missed connection and the new connection with the new delays, this trip from Florida to Missouri (12hr drive) is bordering on "driving would have been faster" territory. Do better @AmericanAir.
@AmericanAir you put my entire day on hold to deliver my bag. It‚Äôs still not here. #garbageair
@AmericanAir I am LIVID! I am a cardholder and customer who recently few wth you. I am missing SEVERAL items from my luggage and my laptop was damaged from my carryon that was forced to be checked. I will NEVER fly with you again. Absolute disgraceful service!!!
Don‚Äôt ever get your bag delivered @AmericanAir. Just go back to the airport and get it yourself. #useless
@AmericanAir not sure what the deal is with your ground crew but I‚Äôm on AA53 and your ground crew are so rude to the flight attendants. They have screwed this flight up so badly and know it so are trying to cover their mess by being incredibly rude to flight crew. Apology needed.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôd rather have my ass beat by a flight attendant on delta than ever fly on here again lol
Never flying @AmericanAir again. Straight conned me out of My first class seats after I paid for it üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My experience with @AmericanAir is by far the worse today. I usually have no complaints about them. But today is ridiculous smh.
@AmericanAir Not warm. Sweat-inducing. How do I go about getting the upgrade refund?
@AmericanAir Thanks! Hopefully they are as helpful as you. You guys are the best. It‚Äôs hard maintaining status when 100% of your flights are personal use &amp; you‚Äôre searching for the cheapest fares in effort to see your hubby who lives across the country on a weekly basis. But we are AA loyal.
Don‚Äôt go anywhere serviced by @AmericanAir because they won‚Äôt get you there!
Wow @AmericanAir. Y'all are killin' it tonight. Flight from HRL-DFW canceled due to equipment problems. $80 cab ride to BRO. Now a 3-hour delay for DFW-TYS due to crew problems. Well played.
Been sitting on a plane for 1 hour in Dallas because @AmericanAir cant get luggage inside the plane? I‚Äôm calling bullshit!
@AmericanAir umm... do priority bags now come after non priority? You may wanna fix that. AA2798
Does anybody else wish they had sippy cups for adults on airplanes so they don‚Äôt spill? Nope? Just me then? @AmericanAir
2/2 ... 17 hours later, still stuck in DFW on @AmericanAir flight to DSM. Daughter says they‚Äôre moving people to front of plane because of cargo issue. Understand it‚Äôs holiday travel, but this cargo thing doesn‚Äôt even sound safe, and flight is delayed AGAIN. Come on, American...
@AmericanAir could have put us up in a hotel n bring us back tomorrow
@AmericanAir so now I go to my final destination with no clothing to wear for three days. You deserve the WORST AIRLINE IN AMERICA AWARD.
@AmericanAir Very important? Like landing a 777 isn‚Äôt? Again.... lame answer. Correct answer: Mr. James, specifically what flight did this happen? 2nd correct answer: Mr. James, please call us immediately at (___)___-____. We need to hear from you ASAP. 3rd correct answer: send me a PM
First flight of my year was over 2 hours delay for maintenance and now the cargo door won‚Äôt open to be able to get us our checked bags. @AmericanAir y‚Äôall still recovering from the nye parties or what
@AmericanAir decided to open and go through both Olivia and my carryon, also just for shits and giggles. Then AA you failed to Update that the flight was delayed until after we ran to board. Now sitting here waiting to BOARD. AGAIN YOU REALLY SUCCCCKKKK
@AmericanAir I write this as I once again sit in Charlotte Douglas after you did not transfer my luggage resulting in our having to go to baggage claim and then leave with friends getting our luggage to go back through TSA for the second time in 3 hours who
@AmericanAir Do you have any help on it? You guys responded but then haven't replied back since you did this tweet. Just trying to grt our trip back to normal.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply. Sorry to hear the A Club is off our list of things to do. ‚òπÔ∏è I was hopeful First Class air‚úàÔ∏è was our golden ticket in. One day we will get to access the A Club!! Save some drinks &amp; snacks for us loyal Advantage Club million miles members for another day!
@AmericanAir then had to detour to Hong Kong and get a driver and WALK ACROSS THE FRICKING BORDER INTO SHENZHEN. Coming home no better- messed that up just as bad. Again you suck.
@AmericanAir That was a quick reply! Thanks
@AmericanAir then bc you are not friends with China Southern you did nothing to help us reschedule causing us to have to spend the night and then the next day sorting out YOUR MESS. Then, had such a short time to connect in Beijing missed the next flight.
I traveled for 13 hours....to go from Cancun to Daytona beach. A 650 mile trip by air.... Canc√∫n to Charlotte was fine, followed by a 3 hour layover and then a 3 hour delay. Upgraded for Charlotte to Daytona. Then lost luggage. Stoked... @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir you suck because out of the last 5 days I‚Äôve had to spend in an airport trying to get somewhere and home you have managed to screw up every flight. Sat on the tarmac at Charlotte Douglas for three hours which casued us to miss our
@AmericanAir where are the bags from flight AA500 in PHX?
@AmericanAir did you report my complaint about not providing your first class passenger a blanket when asked one for their toddler? Y‚Äôall are really stooping real low. 1st your right a lengthy email about taking our criticism into consideration. Next you report our tweet? #lol
Hello @AmericanAir, I‚Äôve just landed at SEA on flight 2009 from DFW. The plane was insufferably hot until the last 15 minutes. I asked every attendant for help. I don‚Äôt know what happened but I would like a refund for my seat upgrade.
Well, @AmericanAir has done it again. Checked 4 bags at MIA; only 3 arrived in EWR. The 1 missing is my 7 year-old‚Äôs new electric scooter that Santa brought. Have called 3x and no agent can get a response from the MIA office after 6 hours and 3 internal messages. Typical.
Our flight from CLT to CMH was supposed to begin boarding 18 minutes ago. Guess what? Not boarding. @AmericanAir never fails to impress.
Shoutout to @AmericanAir for misgendering my seat neighbor while asking what beverages we wanted. Is it so hard to train flight attendants to use gender neutral language?!?!
@AmericanAir not that it matters that I was a first class passenger, but when someone asks for a blanket, I highly recommend you provide a blanket especially if it‚Äôs for my toddler. Also, you sold me a first clas ticket and gave my a business class?
@AmericanAir creeping up on three hours delay and not even a drink or snacks.the grinch treated kids better than this üòî
@AmericanAir I think your missing the point... I don‚Äôt need to earn miles in your airline because I have no intention of ever flying your airline again.
@AmericanAir We was in LA8190 flight... please, could you help us?
@AmericanAir hello... I did lost my flight, and I'm in the airport with my wife and little child... Could tou realocate us to the AA906 flight?
@AmericanAir tried to change my ticket because my young daughter is going first national field hockey tourney and found out too late all friends staying extra day. Hoped AA would understand but snarky customer service denied. #nosympathy #corpgreed #
Diverted 12/29 from CHO to PHF due to weather. They put passengers on previous diverted flights in cabs to CHO, at their expense, resulting in no cabs available. Agent said to rent a car. But now @AmericanAir customer service won't reimburse. They should honor their commitment!
Great flight @AmericanAir #AA889 #PHX -&gt; #AUS.
@AmericanAir I hope customer service does a better job instead of mansplaining breastfeeding handling/transportation to a physician in an email filled with unprofessional and discriminatory (not to mention uncalled for) ‚Äúadvice‚Äù.
@AmericanAir been on the plane for an hour now kinda getting annoyed with youall
@AmericanAir Flight AA 5626 delayed due to a mechanical fault and they have turned down my request to provide ground transportation from GSP to CLT. Where is your ethics?
@AmericanAir Oh wait. It was no internet and no power to my row. But this time I had movies. Thanks, I guess?
BTW, @AmericanAir if you won‚Äôt let passengers off the plane to get food, you should provide it. We should have landed 5 minutes ago and we‚Äôre still waiting for a pilot.
A passenger is saying that his wife needs food because she has diabetes and he‚Äôs told they only have pretzels, but he should go ask in the back of the plane. Nice job @AmericanAir Flight 1386 from Phoenix to Salt Lake City.
@AmericanAir I have, and you have not responded. I will surely be sending a letter to all of the corporate customer response representatives. Your handling of this matter has been unsatisfactory. The policies &amp; procedures should be re-evaluated to be comesurate with customer needs.
@AmericanAir, telling passengers they can get off, but not really. Stopping them at the door and saying if they get off, they aren‚Äôt sure if they can be rebooked.
@AmericanAir makes you pay $30 to check your 1 bag and if you show up early, they put your bag on the flight before yours so you have to wait 2X: carousel &amp; counter, then tell you they‚Äôre protecting your bag &amp; you should thank them! üòÇ #flyDelta
They‚Äôve been saying on @AmericanAir that it‚Äôs going to be 30 minutes more for 2 hours. Really, come on. Sitting in First Class but can‚Äôt get a drink.
On the plane now for 2 hours, crew is now ‚Äúillegally over their flight hours‚Äù. No food, no drinks, no WiFi for entertainment. Flight is 1 hr 15. So glad I‚Äôm platinum elite on @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir took a flight with you guys a day or two ago and completely regret it. The customer service you have, ESPECIALLY the way you treat your US Veterans. NEVER AGAIN. Hopefully you guys start hiring people who truly wanna work and want you to be comfortable.
I know @AmericanAir better give me my miles and stop playing.....
@AmericanAir knocked me out of my seat this past trip with their service. Pilot Chapman on flight 355 GCM to DFW 1/2/19 was amazing. He had the funniest and most polite announcements. YASSS AA!!! Here for you!
Sitting in the Dallas Fort Worth airport right now for an extra 2 Hours WITH A 6 MONTH OLD thanks to @AmericanAir leaving 30 mins late out of Chicago and our connecting flight shutting the doors early and leaving half of the plane stranded. Y‚Äôall gonna do something about this????
@AmericanAir You changed our flight, and now our trip is ruined. Why would you change a flight like that? This is how you get people to not use your service.
@AmericanAir - since you took over USAirways you‚Äôve proven to be the worst airline in the world - the polls agree. You need to learn to manage your people and resources and remember you‚Äôre a service organization. You have truly become a horrible and painful airline to fly with
@AmericanAir #worstcie #yulairport #loststroller #noanswer traveling in 3 days without my babyzen stroller
Come on #dtw we landed almost 45 minutes ago and still no luggage @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir - oh I‚Äôm not done; got a new pilot from PHX and we boarded and departed 5 hours late only to make it to runway and aforementioned pilot told us we going back to gate because the computer was dead. NO ONE COULD HAVE CHECKED THE PLANE IN THE EXTRA 5 HOURS OF DOWNTIME?
@AmericanAir - finally joined Twitter for the sole purpose of telling you how horrible you are. Showed up at SEA for flight this morning at 11 only to be told the pilot ‚Äúcalled in sick‚Äù and the flight would be delayed for 4 hours until you could find another pilot ...
@AmericanAir please don‚Äôt offer to deliver my delayed bag if you‚Äôre going to give me a 6 hour delivery window after 4 hours arrives. This is way less inconvenient.
@AmericanAir Or you prioritize revenue over customer experience, what do I have to pay for a commercial free flight?
@AmericanAir I accidentally qualified for status with you guys this year, is there any way I can give that back? Would rather stick plastic forks in my eyes than voluntarily fly your sack of shit airline
@AmericanAir As stated above. She isn‚Äôt on Twitter. Is there a different means of communication she can use?
@AmericanAir -y‚Äôall are seriously the worst. Plane shows up late. Takes an over 2 hours to get people off the plane and then your worker says ‚Äúboard fast and we will get you on time, or don‚Äôt and you‚Äôll be late‚Äù. Last time I fly with you. üí©
@AmericanAir She is not on Twitter, but reached out to me as a hope to get a different response from the response she has gotten from multiple of your employees. Please DM me how you would like her to get ahold of someone who might actually not mansplain to her about how to feed her child :)
@AmericanAir 11 hours on a plane was nothing compared to 75 minutes in the sub-basement of terminal 4.
@AmericanAir Please respond as to what‚Äôs going on and how this could have happened? My travel agent is trying to rebook same flight for tomorrow. Not sure why it‚Äôs taking so long we need to get back to the U.S. please help
@AmericanAir I definitely think it should be looked into...not only the situation but also the person who wrote the letter. Luckily, this didn‚Äôt happen to me. It happened to another female surgeon, who did reach out to multiple people, managers, etc, and this is the response she got.
@AmericanAir I have a claim already made AA-19BARDEGUEZ-M53F17. I've spoken with numerous agents with no one willing to help fix my situation. I guess I'll try this number but not sure if it will help.
.@AmericanAir I don‚Äôt need to arrive at LAX 30 minutes early if I then have to wait an hour and 15 for the baggage carrousel to even turn on. Totally unacceptable and it‚Äôs every time!
@AmericanAir Now I don‚Äôt even get to sit next to my wife and we got downgraded seats. So much for paying extra for premium seats!!! Your customer service is SO BAD
@AmericanAir lost my luggage that had my wedding dress in it and after 5 months, they still haven't found it! üò≠üòñ I am heartbroken that I lost something this sentimental. Never flying AA again!! üò†
Soo does @AmericanAir have a lost and found?
@AmericanAir (2/2) I will not get in next 2-3 days. Please compensate for at least US$ 1000 for 3 days survival ( medicine , clothes and other items).
@AmericanAir (1/2) As per resource locator :VCVKGE, my flight was cancelled and ticket was modified based on my request to get connection of International flight to Delhi at 0900 PM ( QR) on 2nd January 2020. My 2x checked baggage did not reach at JFK and ...
And just like that.. @AmericanAir just dropped waaaaay off my list... delayed to 10pm while making us stand at the gate for 40 min.
Just got to document this incase we die and American Airlines tries to cover it up; our flight has lost electricity twice since boarding üòÇ only on @AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir needs to sort it‚Äôs baggage handling out. Number one complaint from every. Single. Flight!
@AmericanAir üò≥üò≥ just hope they let me on my return flights without it
Omg my @AmericanAir flight from the US to UK is the oldest plane I‚Äôve seen in SOOO LONG... no screens, no power, no USB, it must be from the 80‚Äôs haha. Step up ur game AA!!!
@AmericanAir Sitting on 1386 in PHX with a friendly reminder that y‚Äôall need to get your shit together. Why would you let a ramp crew leave the gate area before the flight is off is beyond me.
@AmericanAir Please let me know if my morning 8a flight from Las Vegas to Dallas needs volunteers to move to a later flight. It‚Äôs for me and 1 more passenger
@AmericanAir you are literally the worst fucking airline I have ever been on if you would kindly fuck off I‚Äôd appreciate it, pissheads
American Airlines should at least take ownership for mess up, offer comp make efforts to correct issues! Nothing from them. You have to do all the work! Horrible service! @AmericanAir #AATeam
@AmericanAir The ‚Äúoption‚Äù provided was nil. Super disappointing and soured our entire trip. No more AA for us!
Dear @AmericanAir You delayed &amp; then cancelled my flight, with no explanation or compensation. I now have the challenge of extending my stay in Alabama &amp; missed business opportunities; due to your customer care. üó£THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!
I will never use American Airlines again! Now I know why they are rated worst int‚Äôl airlines! @AmericanAir #AATeam
@AmericanAir boarding to LaGuardia and the gate agent checks in a priority passenger right before me and walks away. I'm zone 4 priority so I get in the priority lane. She looks at me and ignores. I ended up going through the 5-9 zone. Yes. I handle customer service on Twitter.
Flight AA 7441. Pd forthis flight for my family 2 months back. Couldn‚Äôt get on flight no good reason why? still don‚Äôt know when leaving. AmericanAir not helping not offering comp making up excuses blaming Malaysia air and blaming travel agent for mistakes @AmericanAir #AATeam
Disappointed the @AmericanAir on this second leg of my family vacation. Stuck in the airport, again. Trying to stay humble.
Here with my family suppose to get on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Chicago with American Air. Tried checking in yesterday couldn‚Äôt told to do it at airport. Came to KUL airport two and half hours early and they said they didn‚Äôt have our names! @AmericanAir #AATeam
@AmericanAir This isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúavailability changing‚Äù. The flight keeps displaying as available after repeated daily searches, but won‚Äôt allow me to book. Reservations keeps saying the same thing‚Äîthat it‚Äôs a system glitch.
@AmericanAir where can I buy an upgrade or be on upgrade list ? Your app is a mess.
Well damn .@AmericanAir just emailed to tell me my miles will be expiring since I‚Äôve had almost 18 months of no activity by not flying their airline. A fact that‚Äôs not going to change short of hell freezing over whilst pigs fly.
Tbh @AmericanAir treated me like royalty the past 4 round trips. Big ups.
@AmericanAir lost an ID on a flight yesterday. How do I go about recovering it?
my favorite sport is filling the fridge w/ all kinds of vegetables but eating leftover airplanes cookies. thanks @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I was on a flight today from Albuquerque to Fresno and my flat iron that was brand new was broken when I got home.
@AmericanAir if i am not able to check in for a flight since i am traveling with an infant and if the flight is oversold, does that mean i am screwed for not checking in earlier?
@AmericanAir I spy with my little eye a delay until 11pm.Hope you prove me wrong ... Flight AA2713
There‚Äôs more dogs than babies on this flight. When did @AmericanAir get so lax on the dog rules?? #BarkingIsTheNewCrying
@AmericanAir Hands down has worst customer service of all airlines!! I acknowledged my part in a not-so-good New Year's travel experience, but not this airline.
@AmericanAir I don‚Äôt want to hear a five minute commercial for a credit card blasted over the intercom of my flight
Finally, I‚Äôm on a connecting flight, and it‚Äôs not full...at all. There are probably 5+ rows empty, but they won‚Äôt allow anyone to sit on those seats. Not sure why, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense because they‚Äôre empty. Oh well ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è @AmericanAir
Never fly with @AmericanAir y‚Äôall they suck
2 airports, 6 missed flights (not my fault), and 6 hours later, never would I have ever thought that I‚Äôd have such an exhausting travel experience. All for a 2hr flight distance @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir chaos at Dallas airport for flight to Cancun! 2 hours wanting to speak with someone, tried several people- not interested as they weren‚Äôt the ‚Äúdesignated agent‚Äù. Agent arrived 1 min before boarding started and refused to answer query as ‚Äúboarding had started‚Äù
@AmericanAir After a 5 hour delay they now determined there is an equipment problem??? Could they not have checked that 5 hours ago? What is wrong with your airline?
Imagine your original flight being delayed multiple times (total = 8hrs), your rescheduled flights also being delayed so you miss your connecting flight, you‚Äôre driven to another airport but they misbook you so you miss that flight as well, and other shenanigans. @AmericanAir
So I‚Äôm riding the plane to Cali. And I wanted to see what the hype was over Hustlers.... Boy let me just say that movie is not appropriate for the aircraft... thx @AmericanAir
Hey @AmericanAir, can you start using non-plastic cups for flights? Better 4 environment.
Hi @AmericanAir. Why dont make the check in on Line for my flight tomorrow?
@AmericanAir My first flight the door closed and we still didn‚Äôt take off for 30 minutes later than said. That logic doesn‚Äôt work obviously
@AmericanAir PLEASE HELP US FLIGHT 1891 PLEASE
@AmericanAir Thanks again! Time with the grandkids is precious!
@AmericanAir This concept is ridiculous... This is a perceived discount, and quite frankly, not real. This used to be the same price for a standard seat and now you've stripped out everything that used to be included.
@AmericanAir I have sent DM regarding my travel issues with my last trip. #CustomerService
@AmericanAir made my mom gate check a bag when there was overhead space in the plane and all her wedding clothes are soaked. Just thought you all should know
@AmericanAir Give me my $30 or go to hell
@AmericanAir this pilot is so attractive please set us up im ready to mingle this new year
Apparently multiple planes are having issues pushing hella flights back, wtf? @AmericanAir needs to give us all our money back because this is probably the worst and stressful trip I've been on and I haven't even left home üòë
So disappointed in @AmericanAir. Your staff is not helpful or compassionate. Will never fly again.
@AmericanAir No one has contacted us after filling out a complaint online for weeks. Is there anyone who can message me to get help? This is so ridiculous.
@AmericanAir You should be aware of when flights are delayed. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm saying i was late to the gate. I was 7 minutes from scheduled departing time. Just doesn‚Äôt make sense when you have to know schedule numerous people into another flight when you still had time to add us.
Thank you @AmericanAir and your #aateam for my first flights of 2020 your cabin and flight crews on AA1444 and 1895 today went above and beyond to make sure these flights were #aamazing #HappyNew2020
@AmericanAir Just did and answered. Thanks for such a diligent service.
@AmericanAir question about baggage policies if possible: if I have a transatlantic flight in Business connecting to a Domestic flight in economy, on a single booking, how does my allowance work? And does this change if the transatlantic arrives one evening, connection next AM.
@AmericanAir Actually, in the last 30 min the departure time has been updated from 6:45pm to 9:00pm to 7:00pm to 9:00 again because of ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù reasons. A better explanation would go a long way towards maintaining loyalty.
@AmericanAir I just was on phone with Exec Platinum desk and with my situation on a change needed I am looking to get miles for the return flight. I had to be the new date return via points. But alas I get no EQMs or EQDs on the new reservation.
@AmericanAir perhaps you should share it with your crews. They seem to be fairly powerless.
Let me get this straight @AmericanAir, you have pilots on call but don‚Äôt double check that he even shows up until the entire plane is already boarded? He then calls out after we were scheduled to take off üòÇüòÇ what the fuck is this shit I just wanna go hOoOOoMEeee
I am in a @AmericanAir flight that has a plane with monitors that come down from the ceiling of the plane every few rows. My kids asked what this was. They did not understand how it worked. It is an old plane.
Why didn‚Äôt I fly frontier? I paid 400 dollars for a plane ticket and the air wasn‚Äôt working....the most miserable flight I‚Äôve ever been on @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I think it‚Äôs pitiful that folks have tickets for flights but because it was booked short notice due to a hospital appointment (flying to the Mayo Clinic) they can‚Äôt select their seats without being extorted out of additional funds. #extortion #areyallthathardup,iam
@AmericanAir That‚Äôs exactly what we did we checked in in online on the dot when online check in was available. There were no seats that were available to switch even though we purchased an upgraded economy ticket through british airways that would allow us to
Filed a report with @AmericanAir about my missing Avenue Sling Bag... was told I‚Äôd hear back in 24 hours regarding my bag... it‚Äôs now day 3 and still no one has reached out üò°
Wow @AmericanAir I‚Äôm just trying to look up a past baggage receipt and both customer service agents were condescending, rude, and unhelpful. I don‚Äôt get it. Do better y‚Äôall ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hey @AmericanAir, it‚Äôs one thing to ground a plane and make me miss my connection‚Äî but, then to be yelled at and dismissed by your gate attendants is absolutely unacceptable. Guess we‚Äôre starting this decade by vowing not to fly American ever again. üò§üëãüèΩ
@AmericanAir So far so good! The flight attendants are awesome and the pretzels are killer... And thanks for the inflight wifi! Now I can surf instead of work... üòÜ
@AmericanAir I already got the info by calling and waiting a bunch on the phone and talking to a (very helpful) agent. The issue is... fix your website! this should've taken 10 seconds. It's 2020 and your website is embarassing.
@AmericanAir Thanks to your customer relations department I was able to change my flight with only a .20 cents difference! Thanks for having a ‚ù§Ô∏è
We landed over 35 min ago, y‚Äôall should at least be able to tell us which carousel to go to at this point! I usually fly @AmericanAir in/out of PHL and w/ them it‚Äôs usually only about 20 min from getting off the plane to having the bags in hand.
Dear @AmericanAir welcome to 2020. Might I suggest a system where you might digitally track your parts and know exactly when and where to locate them so we don't spend 2 hours sitting on a plane in hopes of departing only to have those dreams crushed!! #stuckinatx
@AmericanAir ya'll really going to cancel my flight and then offer me a 9 hour layover.. you gotta be kidding me. I love arriving to cons a whole ass day late. What a waste of money.
@AmericanAir thanks for fucking my day up
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm not concerned about the extra wait. I‚Äôm concerned that you wouldn‚Äôt check the plane thoroughly before loading everyone and almost taking off. The last 4 AA flights if been on have been delayed/cancelled for AA issues specifically.
Honestly have never heard of such poor customer service in my life @AmericanAir just downright terrible customer service &amp; ethics.
For those who had extra SWUs deposited into their accounts, @AmericanAir has issued a statement: ‚ÄúAmerican Airlines experienced a system error that incorrectly awarded a small number of AAdvantage members additional systemwide upgrades on December 31, 2019...
@AmericanAir how do you kick everyone off last minute. Where‚Äôs the replacement pilot the stewardess mentioned??? I need to get home!!!
Just took the last of my medicine &amp; can‚Äôt even make it home in time for my next dose. Wtf. Thanks a lot. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Hi. I am currently on a flight and purchased wifi to address a matter that just happened in the air. I hope to receive your reply as soon as possible. Thank you.
@AmericanAir flight 1891 from EWR to CLT was just deplaned because the captain called in?? Seriously? How do you not know that before boarding?
Just had to get off my @AmericanAir flight because their pilot decided to call out last minute. Un-fucking-believable.
@AmericanAir Hell no. You‚Äôre not worth the follow. Also, now my flight is delayed again. You really are the worse airline. Breaking ankles is more important than anything else I guess.
Fuck @AmericanAir! Only place where they charge $30 for each checked bag just to lose it and have their customer support laugh in your face when you ask to have the $30 refunded. Would rather get dragged by my feet out of a flight than deal with them again #americanairlines
Finally arrived home after 3 flights and 14 hours and now my checked bags are missing ... and you have me a small voucher ... unacceptable @AmericanAir
Wow @AmericanAir and Laredo International Airport, you just cancelled all flights for the rest of the day just like that. Wow, no words. #stuckintexas #AmericanAirlines #flyingsucks
@AmericanAir Cool! But will you be able to help me?
@AmericanAir Of course you are. Always on top of things!
@AmericanAir You have a flight 1492 to/from Columbus? Thought you'd like to know someone got it.
@AmericanAir I am so disappointed. I am missing my Portland flight from Phoenix because my puerto Vallarta flight is delayed 3 hours. Now I will miss my flight out from PDX to LA tomorrow. This is very frustrating.
@AmericanAir Why is AA672 still being delayed? Already suffered a cancellation and significant delay today.
@AmericanAir Thanks. DM on its way.
@AmericanAir Read through this, and only made me more upset. We‚Äôre entitled to a stroller and a diaper bag. I had to argue with the gate agent not to check my roll-aboard. And that they made us wait until group 6 to board. Also please confirm: should the child be buckled on the lap, or loose?
So glad I‚Äôm flying a second 5hr flight on @AmericanAir in the last 2 months that‚Äôs without internet or entertainment. Super jobüëç
@AmericanAir thanks for canceling my flight, you suck.
Boy, has @AmericanAir screwed up at nearly every turn during our holiday travel. Just the worst.
i have an unexpected CT scan i need to get home for and tried to get my flight changed with @AmericanAir and wow i just should‚Äôve known better that they would suck. brb, spending money i don‚Äôt have on a brand new ticket ü•¥
And while we are at it @AmericanAir why do you want to charge me ¬£¬£ to call your desk at Heathrow?? It‚Äôs like you are hoping I don‚Äôt use my voucher
@AmericanAir 5 hour flight to Phoenix and I had planned on doing work and of course the internet is down. That‚Äôs totally unacceptable on such a long flight especially. It‚Äôs 2020 come on!
@AmericanAir Flew BOS to PHX nChristmas Day in "First". Just awful. No holiday cheer, no welcome drink, when meal came, ignored. "Want the whole can" in a terse voice. In FIRST? No offers of refills. "you wanna sundae"? thought it was rt. PHX to BOS on 26th proper service. Bad.
@AmericanAir still waiting for a response
Hey @AmericanAir how come your phones aren‚Äôt working? I‚Äôm calling intl in order to redeem a travel voucher and numbers aren‚Äôt working. I‚Äôm in the middle of the U.K., not close to a ticket counter
@AmericanAir Nice to know your stewardess are trained to first ignore, then yell at your customers.
@AmericanAir good afternoon and happy new year AA social media team - a DM is being sent with a request. Thx and see you (a lot) this year.
@AmericanAir your gate attendants gave me the exit row seat on 3 flights this week and being 6‚Äô9‚Äù that shit means a lot ‚úäüèº side note this is my first positive tweet about an airline
I've been on 2 @AmericanAir flights in 3 days. Both delayed for "cargo numbers". Now sitting at gate 1 hr past depart time. "We'll get there eventually" doesn't give me back my time.
@AmericanAir Thanks so much. Appreciate the help!
@AmericanAir I assume y‚Äôall have done a study on carryon size to best fit in overhead bins? Wonder if reducing the size of allowable carryons (from 22‚Äù to 20‚Äù will allow each person to get a bag on, if desired.
Question @AmericanAir - how does someone with no status and had someone put in a SWU on Dec. 27th jump someone who is EXP and Million Miler and requested SWU in June for the same flight?
@AmericanAir Why is your website so terrible? Trying to find the most basic info about my reservation (ticket #?, Fare code?, Fight miles?) is impossible. It's embarrassing.
@AmericanAir Why Are Your CSR So Rude To Customers?
Can anyone @AmericanAir explain how you can board an entire flight start the engine and then...have the pilot say ‚Äúsorry folks this plane is actually out of commission.‚Äù What does that mean? Why were we so close to being in the air with an out of commission plane? #airtravel
Here we go with @AmericanAir again.. my bag was checked I got to the gate, currently sitting in my seat and all of a sudden my ‚Äúchecked bag is now ripped and they don‚Äôt know if it will make the flight‚Äù what happened between the time I checked my bag and got on the plane??!
@AmericanAir Final carrier is Gulf air, but I don't have any relationship with them, I travel usually with AA and have EP. The stroller gate side checkin was missed by AA. My tickets are direct with AA , I will be reaching us next week, and won't be easy way to contact gulf air. AA owns
@AmericanAir Already tried. No options. #notsurprised
@AmericanAir BA don‚Äôt take dogs in the cabin ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ I have to go cargo. Mum will not let it happen. An old dog of ours went to Saudi and never came back after 7 yrs because of rules said he was too old. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
@AmericanAir I was given two additional SWUs on 12/31 and then they were just taken away. What is going on? I Was hoping it was a goodwill gift to make up for the terrible operational performance and fake maintenance delays this year but I guess not.
@AmericanAir I just bought through Expedia and this isn‚Äôt really explained. With most other airlines you can pay a penalty to change. Can nothing be done just to change destination? Our kids have been asked to be a wedding for a close family friend.
@AmericanAir Well you could start by getting everyone on the same page, and not making promises you can‚Äôt keep. Also, you could teach the staff how to NOT run over guests when driving things in the walkway, because that kid definitely just broke his ankle due to AA staff.
@AmericanAir No one has let me speak to a manager
Think @AmericanAir flight attendants should follow the rules if they are not on duty. The smaller bag goes below the seat in front of you #binhog #followtherules ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò°
@AmericanAir Which my dog can do.
@AmericanAir what happened to flight 1089 BGI to MIA. NO ONE HAS ANY CONFIRMED OFFICIAL INFORMATION, only word of mouth and for people with internet the knowledge that you've rebooked our flights...
@AmericanAir I need to be rebooked on an upcoming flight after the flight I paid for was rescheduled for three hours earlier. Can't get anyone to pick up on the 800 number. Can't get anyone to reply to a DM.
@AmericanAir 2nd flight in 3 days, both delayed by "cargo numbers" - frequent flyer or not, I think I might be done with you. #fail #amatuers
@AmericanAir I'm having a problem with a flight. I sat on the runway for nearly an hour last night in Seattle. It took me nearly 20 hours to go home, slower than driving. When I approached desks at DFW response of "IM ON BREAK" or "LINE OPENS IN 20 min" before I could say HI.
@AmericanAir doesn‚Äôt care about seating minors under 10 with the single parent they are traveling with. My 3 kids are all over the plane on a 9 hour flight &amp; no one wants to help when we were all sitting together prior. This isn‚Äôt the first time AA!
@AmericanAir Flight out of Greenville SC was delayed, landed in E Terminal in Charlotte, flight was already boarding B16. Due to pain there was no way I could make it. Manager Allen Anderson got me to my gate before the doors closed! Thank you so much Mr. Anderson, well done AA!
@AmericanAir Now I'm on my return flight and the headphones you provide don't work with your screen because the jack is loose. So frustrating to have problem after problem with your airline.
@AmericanAir This statement is so false! I‚Äôm a parent traveling alone w/3 kids under 10 alone &amp; we don‚Äôt have seats anywhere near each other; total flight over 9 hrs &amp; no one will help us. So sad &amp; not the first time this has happened with AA.
@AmericanAir worst customer service I‚Äôve ever experienced - separating families who‚Äôve bought their tickets together and then asking us to pay $140 per seat just so we can sit together? Such a scam. Will never fly American again - you should be ashamed.
@AmericanAir Got it a little after 10am today
@AmericanAir You put me through a double schedule change on my family‚Äôs booking (from nonstop to a connection with two young kids) and now you can‚Äôt assign me seats on one of the flights? I call in &amp; am told nothing can be done &amp; to just wait until the airpor my releases seats!
@AmericanAir is there a way to keep your YTD after 12 months?
My 16 pound dog can‚Äôt go on an @AmericanAir flight because she‚Äôs too tall of a chihuahua. This is madness.
@AmericanAir you would think with the holiday travel season you wouldn‚Äôt allow your planes to leave early... especially connecting flights.
Because of my flight delay, I might actually miss seeing Brad Pitt in person tomorrow in LA!!! Ugh I‚Äôm so mad at you @AmericanAir üò°üò°üò° #flyunitedinstead #americanairlines
@AmericanAir Too late....I need to be in Pittsburgh by 6pm to make it to my daughtes basketball game..... I will be calling your 800 number to get a full refund and more. Noone at LGA even tried to help.
My flight delayed before the holidays, now my return flight delayed after the holidays. Will be missing my connection again. Do better, @AmericanAir üò° #americanairlines #flightproblems
@AmericanAir Thank you! And we were upgraded.üëçüèø
Another @AmericanAir flight, another delay. Everyone is boarded and now we are waiting on a maintenance person to reset something. AA561... #3ringcircus
Hey @AmericanAir how do I change a FFN..? Impossible to do online. Any options..?
Hey @AmericanAir not sure if you heard, but 3 weeks ago I was hit by a car and had to travel home for the holidays earlier than expected BUT was still charged $500 to move my flight up. ü§î Any way we can remedy this with a refund or credit? I got the doctor‚Äôs notes to prove it!
@AmericanAir Shirley C who is working the customer service desk at Gate C is the MVP. After being given wrong information about laying over she found me a flight near my destination for very little cost. I didn‚Äôt know how I was getting home but took that stress away. 100 stars!!
@AmericanAir We‚Äôve already gone through this cycle.
@AmericanAir flight attendant told me last night they don‚Äôt allow people with tight connections to get off first. We missed our flight. This morning on rebooked flight people with tight connections were allowed to get off first. #discrimination
@AmericanAir your gate attendant at Miami Gate E2 is one of the worst I‚Äôve experienced. Attidue and unprofessional.
@AmericanAir never misses an opportunity to disappoint. Unfortunately, this kind of consistency isn‚Äôt a good thing #AmericanAirlinesIsTheWorst
@AmericanAir Kudos to the flight crew that managed the best landing I've ever had on flt #2819 into new Orleans today.
@AmericanAir I didn‚Äôt change my flight. I simply kept my return flight. Again, this is where your arbitrary company policy conflicts with reason.
Seriously flying sucks but @AmericanAir nickel and dimes you like no other. Pay for upgraded seats still wants you to pay for better boarding....
@AmericanAir do you have a 1st class lounge at SeaTac?
@AmericanAir Worst airline out there right now. Never again
@AmericanAir Thanks so much. Will message you now.
Huge thank you to the @AmericanAir flight attendant who not only noticed we‚Äôd left a bag in the overhead compartment, but found us in baggage claim to give it to us (we wouldn‚Äôt have noticed it was missing till we got home). Great customer service! (Flt 29 from MIA to BOS on 1/2)
@AmericanAir OMD luff you. When are you going to fly from LHR to DEN. I can go to work Dad ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥. Bloody BA and United üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
@AmericanAir You new mileage redemption rates are a JOKE . I'm so sorry I spent money with you to become and EXP.
@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed for over 7 hours
@AmericanAir I am an ExecPlat 1.8m miler. 2x in the last week the website ‚Äúexperienced tech difficulties‚Äù &amp; the fare I selected went up by over $200. Cancelled, went through Google to AA and bought the original fare. It appears you are trying to rip us off! #NotHappy!
@AmericanAir Completely unfair and inappropriate options
@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed for over 7 hours. üôÉüôÉüôÉ
En repetidas ocasiones, durante los √∫ltimos a√±os, me quej√© de @AmericanAir... Hoy, despu√©s de unas vacaciones viajando con ellos, debo reconocer que han mejorado much√≠simo. Su servicios de tierra y en el aire fue extraordinario. Thank You!
@AmericanAir is it really true that I can‚Äôt change flights for my family of 5 for a 03/20 travel date? We usually fly delta- they allow change w/ a penalty. I‚Äôm shocked the only way to change with AA is to eat the cost of all 5 flights and book new ones! Poor customer service!
@AmericanAir 12:13pm and still not in the air
Any freelance journalists want a juicy corrupt airline story? @AmericanAir are attempting to claim I didn‚Äôt fly with them to avoid responsibility for me missing my flight because their wheelchair services forgot me‚Äîtheir name is literally on my boarding passes and they‚Äôre...
@AmericanAir Yes all worked out! Thank you!
@AmericanAir Thanks! Just spoke with the nicest person on the phone
@AmericanAir Imagine thinking that arbitrary "company policy" makes logical sense or comports with any level of reasonable customer service.
.@AmericanAir y'all made me real sad today. I'm just trying to get home and y'all keep canceling my flight. üò≠üò≠
@AmericanAir does everyone in my family need their own frequent flyer number?
@AmericanAir Apology not accepted for the additional 19 hour wait due to maintenance, bringing my annual maintenance wait time to well over 60 hours with you
UPDATE: @AmericanAir is *NOT* going on the list
Shameful customer service again from @AmericanAir - telling me I have to pay $545 to get to my next status level when im only $115 away. What kind of scam are you trying to run?
@AmericanAir Just landed in PHX on AA Flight 2185 from RDU. I want to send a shout-out to the Dianne/Diane agent team working the flight out of RDU. Great, funny agents! To the ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù that came up out of nowhere and created bag chaos! learn to be nicer no need to be rude!
If there‚Äôs one thing you can count on flying @AmericanAir its that your American Eagle operated by Mesa flight will be delayed.
@AmericanAir for others of us (me plus I saw at least 8-10 others in same boat), instead ordering us to haul our bags to a different terminal, which forced us to wait in domestic checkin lines to eventually drop bags, losing precious time.
@AmericanAir No argument there. If the bag re-check was even halfway sensible I would have made the connection. After talking to others my sense is this was staff error, taking bags at the correct recheck point when we exit customs for some, while ...
@AmericanAir Please just remind your gate agents in Detroit that telling someone they can pre-board does not mean then boarding 'concierge' passengers ahead of them. Thanks!
Hey @AmericanAir we‚Äôre all set with a freshly printed boarding pass with a seat assignment thanks to the lovely ticket agent at Gate C3 in BNA. Please pass on she is the face of customer service! üëçüèº
Stuck in Birmingham thanks to @AmericanAir mechanical problem. Counter staff keep telling everyone to wait patiently. About to miss my connection in Charlotte.
@AmericanAir Don‚Äôt give me your canned answers I work in customer service. The fact is she was racist and it‚Äôs super unfortunate to have to deal with that in 2020. I‚Äôll send my info via DM
@AmericanAir There‚Äôs no reason those empty seats couldn‚Äôt have been filled by someone already in the plane after push off.
Have you ever booked a flight and somehow lost the reservation that was sent(??) to your email?... asking for a friend and for @AmericanAir to help üò≠
@AmericanAir crisis averted! thanks to Alexis at the PP help desk, we will be home just a few hours late. Give Alexis some props - she rocks!
@AmericanAir there were open seats and open spaces! it was completely unnecessary and arbitrary and I was met with rudeness from your staff! :(
No more @AmericanAir for me. Tried to use credit from a return flight that was cancelled bc of tropical storm Imelda. Was told I have to pay $200 to use my credit üò©üò†
@AmericanAir Thanks for calling me back when my kids called me and I hit the "end" button on our phone call by accident. And thanks for taking care of my issue.
@AmericanAir I lost my wallet Tuesday and made a claim. I can‚Äôt seem to reach anyone at American Airlines to inquire about my missing wallet. And my name is pretty long and gets botched, can anyone help?
@AmericanAir AA‚Äôs ‚Äúintegrated operations‚Äù have made them the most poorly reviewed airline of the past few years, and with good reason: endless flight cancellations, a maintenance worker strike, and callous customer service. Standard cancellation excuse: ‚Äúit‚Äôs the weather‚Äù
@AmericanAir can someone contact me about buddy passes I purchased from an employee.
Worst customer service award goes to @AmericanAir ! Numerous emails (with limited characters because you don‚Äôt have a choice) and STILL no one has gotten back to me!!
@AmericanAir how is it I am sold a buddy pass that was unusable so I ended up not only paying for the buddy pass but $3500 for one way tickets to get to the destination?
@AmericanAir As I mentioned the final destination JED lost and found is asking me to go to JED and pick it up. I am in Dammam now, I need AA to get it back
@AmericanAir, just got diverted to BHM and going to miss my connection. Can you help?
Other passengers i spoke to are equally pissed, some missed work, business meetings, one guy even missed his OWN WEDDING. Such great work @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I booked since Sept to go to Madrid March 2020, you changed planes and bumped my 2 premium seats together! Unbelievable but I shouldn't be shocked. This is terrible service only want to seat me in the middle for a 9 hr flight when I pd premium.
Hey guys never fly @AmericanAir piece of crap company with racist employees.
@AmericanAir So, to reach executive platinum status, you have to go to jail in Mexico. Got it. Nice to see you guys congratulating someone on getting arrested, btw. üòÇ
.@AmericanAir Not sure what the point of your reward mile flight booking system is when you can't correct a three-week old glitch that keeps saying "one or more of your reward flights" is no longer available. And yes, I've called too. Endless frustration...
I have to rebook transportation from the airport to the hotel, oh speaking of the hotel i wont arrive in time to use the suite i paid for on January 3rd, $275 wasted and down the drain. Thanks so much again @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir She tried to check in but it never gave her a boarding pass.
Is it me or have the major airlines decided to go heavy on the bath salts before pricing for 2020? $2,589 for an economy RT booked between NYC &amp; London nearly five months in advance, @AmericanAir? And they're not the only one...
... And another delay on the layover. 0 for 2 today @AmericanAir #flightdelay
@AmericanAir not happy with you guys. Don‚Äôt usually fly American and the one time I do, you lose my bag. Then when you find and deliver it, it‚Äôs damaged significantly.
@AmericanAir AA Website. Still showing that on an existing itinerary of mine.
Recently bought first class tix w/ @AmericanAir to Mexico with my wife. All four flights delayed, first one by 5hrs. Our re-book got me seated in coach. No refund, no apology. Mexico was amazing, but never ever flying with AA again.
@AmericanAir I left a medical device at seat 25 B on flight 781 that landed at Charlotte Douglas International Airport at 8:45 pm on 1/1/2020. I know where it is when I left it and no one can help me. Can you please help me?
Seems a bit unfair for @AmericanAir to allow ppl to check lg carryons at gate when I paid $30 (international flight) to ck my luggage.
Okay @AmericanAir my travel buddy doesn‚Äôt have a seat assignment for the second leg of our trip home today. Hope this flight isn‚Äôt overbooked... üôÑ
@AmericanAir So i‚Äôm on flight AA 193 it was delayed for 10 hours because the pilot lied about a maintenance issue to push his time pass 16 hours, so he wouldnt have to fly. Now he is pulling the same crap, the flight is scheduled for 10:30 and right now it is 10:12 and the pilot
@AmericanAir FAT three flights to check in and 1 person working. Sad.
@AmericanAir I've sent this in a message, thanks
I take it back, they put me on a flight that goes straight to LA instead of Chicago to LA @AmericanAir you are forgivenüòå but i still aint flying through y‚Äôall again lmao
@AmericanAir love you guys! Another great travel year! Only 1 issue on our FC travel home...my seat would not recline all the way (only 50%) and wouldn‚Äôt stay set in one position. I didn‚Äôt alert the staff because I didn‚Äôt want my seat to hold up the flight! :(
@AmericanAir clearly didn‚Äôt clean flight 1902 from BOS to CLT because on top of the gross half eaten food in my seat someone a couple rows up said there was already a jacket that had been on the seat when she got there. It wasn‚Äôt hers or anyone‚Äôs around her.
Have never been so pleased with an airline. Thank you @AmericanAir for giving a full refund within 24 hours of booking!! Much appreciated.
No more @AmericanAir for me. I‚Äôve been stranded in Phoenix for 12 hours because there‚Äôs no pilot. No voucher, no compensation, nothing. Sleeping in an airport sucked.
@AmericanAir Still waiting and having the same issue now not being permitted to check in using the APP for our return flights.
@AmericanAir Now is not the time.
@AmericanAir - you changed our flight time and now we think we might miss our connecting flight as you have only given us an hour to change between terminals 4 and 5 in LAX for our flight to Hawaii! Please can you help?
Great flight from PHL to DAY today on @AmericanAir Patrick was the best! Thanks.
@AmericanAir The delivery co rep was standing right next to the boards, claimed the driver "forgot" them last night. He would not deliver directly, would have to wait until this afternoon. AA rep didn't intervene. This has definitely delayed his trip and ability to surf. #compensationdue
@AmericanAir Any chance I can get a refund for my flight today? Got the stomach flu and I'm way too sick to fly
@AmericanAir These flights oddly netted me 250 eqms! A leg! Even tho I bought economy plus fares for all legs. This put me at just under at 149950 for the year. I never would have spent the extra money if I couldn‚Äôt get those SW upgrades. Please help
@AmericanAir 2 things happened. I have religiously taken a London to Edinburgh flight at BA‚Äôs economy plus rate (NOT BASIC ECONOMY) for this I have always got 500 eqms base for every flight. In December I took two roundtrips to Edinburgh from London and Amsterdam from London.
thanks @AmericanAir for changing gates without notice and making me miss my flight! I am NEVER flying American again, there is ALWAYS some kind of issue.
@AmericanAir customer service hung up on DD while trying to get my SIL #marine back to base from diverted flight because of YOUR flight paperwork errors. #mistreated #norespect
@AmericanAir 419JFB6. In early December I called in about paying a $3775 difference to have exec plat Thru the year. I specifically asked when I called if I buy exec plat now and I hit 150 eqms will get another 2 system wide upgrades. I was told yes given the reservations I had in queue.
@AmericanAir Yeah but it‚Äôs still trash like I said. Other airlines have a better system.
@AmericanAir made me check my carry on when there is plenty of room in the overhead? and pulled no one else but my partner and i out of the line to do the same? and then ignored me when i asked why they did that? what kind of service is that
@AmericanAir we tried working with the staff...inadequate response. In order to get the boards today so he can continue on his trip, he has to drive back to the airport. #notgoodservice Boards should have been delivered immediately this morning when located.
When you have to sit in the plane for an hour and a half because they didn‚Äôt de-ice the plane and find that a valve doesn‚Äôt close, and end up missing you connection üôÉ @AmericanAir #dontflyAA
Well done @AmericanAir for refunding our miles and taxes for flights we had to cancel due to medical reasons.
@AmericanAir thank you for such a kind flight attendant out of LAX at 5:30am (flight 1881). I was traveling with four kids ages 2-13, and she was so attentive. Great work!
I am 6‚Äô2‚Äô‚Äô. One day I hope @AmericanAir can build a plane with a high enough headrest that doesn‚Äôt dig into my shoulders forcing me to slouch for 13 hours which kills my neck and back.
@AmericanAir Good morning! Where do I send a receipt for reimbursement due to a cancelled flight?
@AmericanAir Um that reply has nothing to do with my post. Y‚Äôall really need to stop the mindless positive ‚ÄúWe are awesome! Fly with us again!‚Äù responses that ignore whatever your customers actually say on social media...
@AmericanAir has the worst flight miles system. You can‚Äôt get a good flight. It‚Äôs better to redeem miles for hotel
@AmericanAir very disappointed with your baggage customer service. Delayed bag from Tues. with surfboards not delivered yesterday as promised. No one at customer service helping to liaison with delivery service. Very frustrating, ruining my grandson's surfing trip.
@AmericanAir Not just me. Just make it easy for international arrivals to re-drop their checked bag after customs, rather than getting stuck with new domestic checkins and missing their connections. Easy üëç
@AmericanAir just drove 2 hrs to RDU to pick up UM. Was told couldn‚Äôt bring 2 parents in‚Äî only 1 was allowed back. Is this a policy change? Have always been allowed 2 parents in the past.
@AmericanAir Then you probably should have. Would have avoided a lot of discomfort for many passengers (including our party of 4) flying from Hawaii-DFW-DTW. The woman was clearly ill...
@AmericanAir Might as well give me that "complimentary" checked bag before going through TSA, so I can pack something to take home instead of foregoing bringing stuff because it wouldn't make it through TSA--only for me to have a checked bag anyways.
@AmericanAir Yessir so how are we going to fix this?
@AmericanAir It's also ridiculous to immediately announce the boarding of Group 9 whilst telling them they will all have to check their bags. It costs $30 to add on a checked bag, but we are forced to check a bag "complimentary" for being the last boarding group.
@AmericanAir So, not only did they downright treat a customer poorly for not "paying premium," they were downright lying about the situation to begin with.
@AmericanAir The gate agents went as far as saying that they were "informed" that there is no more bin space left, but then the flight crew told the passengers when we were boarding that there is plenty of space and they hadn't told the gate agents anything about checking bags.
@AmericanAir And while I understand the sentiment (they were trying to check bags to make space), putting the blame on a customer for not being able to afford guaranteed bin space is a downright nasty thing to do...especially when when we boarded, there was plenty of space left.
There was no where near enough earbuds for everyone who needed them which meant I could not watch any of the movies or shows like normal. My father was also hit with the snack cart and the flight attendant told him there‚Äôs nothing we can do about. Do better @AmericanAir smh üò§
@AmericanAir It's not customer-centric when they lambaste a customer (not me) by telling them "well, you should have paid for premium if you wanted to have overhead bin space!" It was the holidays and not everyone can afford to spend copious amounts of money for premium amenities.
@AmericanAir mmmmm no potable water on this flight # 5091 ..seriously? That should be a maintenance event. Oh and therefore no coffee ... cmon guys you can do better than that....
@AmericanAir, the gate agents working C81 at MCI for flight AA2410 to DFW really needed to learn some tact in how they interact with customers. While I often side with service workers because they have to take the impact of customer complaints, they were the cause of the problem.
@AmericanAir, you promised me a specialist would contact me ASAP and that never happened. Then when I bugged you again today, you said you would forward the information to a specialist for review. Does that mean I cannot speak to any real human over the phone about my bag?
Experience traveling with disabled on @AmericanAir. First, they didn‚Äôt want to put on record that I needed a wheelchair for... some reason because they insisted it would be better for me in some way that it go unrecorded.
@AmericanAir Thanks. There is none available for moving, other than for a big fee. Hopefully they can do something there.
@AmericanAir hi! I paid extra to be able to pick my seats for a trip in April. I got an alert that flights were changed. Now we don‚Äôt have seats assigned for departure and it won‚Äôt let me select. I‚Äôm traveling with a child, an infant and husband. Can you help?
@AmericanAir So far so good. About to buy myself a mimosa and have relaxing flight.
@AmericanAir what is your policy of allowing sick individuals on your flights? woman in front of us was visibly ill (coughing and throwing up before takeoff).
FUUUUCK YOU @AmericanAir can't even run a simple back drop at LAX. FUUUCK YOU
@AmericanAir I want to get the new flight status of 1/1/20 AA175 because the original flight was diverted last night and my families are on the flight. I‚Äôve tried but I couldn‚Äôt find it. Could you help me?
@AmericanAir You wouldn‚Äôt happen to have nutrition info posted anywhere for your inflight meals would you?
@AmericanAir last night I was leaving Charlotte, North Carolina and didn‚Äôt leave till two hours after the schedule time
Do you think if a flight is up in the air on new years eve and it hits 12 the captain and co pilot kiss? @AmericanAir
I am posting way too many quality financial advisor and softbank memes on here to not have executive platinum influencer status, what's this about @AmericanAir?
Dear @AmericanAir first time flying with you a couple months ago with you was a disaster. Let‚Äôs see how round 2 goes. #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir What happened to the specialist you said would contact me????
@AmericanAir Finally at my destination and no bags. You guys are on fire today!
@AmericanAir You said you‚Äôd help me ‚ÄúASAP‚Äù last night, never did and now you‚Äôre ignoring my DMs. Are you going to help me at all???
The head of our @AmericanAir crew delivered a beautiful and extensive history of Hawai'i over the intercom as we prepared to take off. Awesome!
@AmericanAir thanks for breaking my son‚Äôs car seat even though it was GATE CHECKED and then making it 10000x harder to file a claim. I fly every two months or less, will make sure you‚Äôre flights get filtered out
@AmericanAir I can‚Äôt tell you guys how furious I am right now. I paid a very large sum of money to finish off to executive platinum BEFORE the years end and took two day trip flights while on vacation to hit 150k eqms and grab another 2 SW upgrades. I feel robbed!
.@AmericanAir My flight was supposed to depart at 8:18 from GDL it's 9:19 we're still on the tarmac... I'm going to lose my connection at this rate
@AmericanAir anything I can do to get my daughter and husband seated together for their flights tomorrow? They were assigned seperate seats. He is taking her to her 1st duty station and we want all the time we can get!
i know theres nothing i can really do but @AmericanAir you fucked me over so hard i am shaking.,,,, the things i could say about the workers and their familes would land me in jail much less the execution of such actions
@AmericanAir Thank you for locating my item. In 30 minutes, I was able to get information and have them ship it to me. This is excellent customer service. Thank you American Airlines team. Happy New Year!!!
@AmericanAir what has happened to you? I cannot rely on you.
@AmericanAir What a lousy start to the year AA! Went on the app to pick my seat 2 days ago and it automatically put in my upgrade with no opt out! Screen locked and I did not ok payment. Showed up early to try and downgrade. Told I had no choice: pay $80.
Hey @AmericanAir if I flew to New York last Monday and I JUST NOW made an account, can I claim those miles or‚Äî
@AmericanAir Thanks for the info, will follow up through that link.
Had you had a great experience, you would‚Äôve THANKED them for giving you the opportunity to have a good experience instead of straight cash. So yeah, don‚Äôt blame. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir You should be bringing in a plane from standby to replace this one. What are you going to do to compensate those who have connecting flights today to SFO that now, likely will be missed?
@AmericanAir I'm not asking for a refund on my ticket. I would like compensation for my flight change costs for a flight missed due to an avoidable cancellation of an AA flight. In a fair world, you should also compensate for a day of missed work. Weather delays acceptable. But not staffed?
@AmericanAir I don't care about getting into London later; I booked Business for a reason and would like to fly it. Can I take the later flight out of CUN and take the 22.30 to LHR? Thanks
@AmericanAir Then can we get a flight that does have business, or at least give one of us business class please?
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve filed a formal complaint as I believe I should have had access to my full seat based on my full fare and your policy. When will I receive a reply?
@AmericanAir Maintenance delay? Shouldn't maintenance be done BEFORE, you roll it up to the gate to take on a full flight? They've been sitting on the aircraft since before 7am. It's ridiculous.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve already landed. The flight was full and I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass the passenger by calling attention to this. The crew should have followed your policy.
@AmericanAir Flight AA1887 was supposed to leave at 7:15am. It's still at the gate, and not leaving until 8:30am. How can the first flight of the day be delayed from the first city of takeoff?
@AmericanAir Now I have to stop in Dallas on my way to NY. the connecting flight is 10 minutes apart. I hope I don‚Äôt Miss that being that my pet has not eaten since last night. This is a nightmare. And I had paid for extra legroom. And now I‚Äôm uncomfortable! what kind of seat am I getting??
@AmericanAir I sat next to someone requiring an extension and could not use the arm rest. I‚Äôd estimate that on this full flight about 1/4 of my seat was taken.
@AmericanAir my flight (business class ticket) has been cancelled CUN to ORD and you have rebooked me in economy to JFK Can you help with this please?
@AmericanAir I contacted Etihad, they said AA cancelled flight, you're responsible for any compensation and they told me to ask AA to contact etihad if you had any questions. I read regulations online, they seem to be correct, AA is responsible. You cancelled a flight for being understaffed
Awesome flight with @AmericanAir today. Huge shoutout to our flight attendant who made our experience and everyone around us fun!
@AmericanAir had an unfortunate accident while on vacation &amp; severely sprained an ankle. Need to arrange some accomodation for flight on the 4th. Can you help?
@AmericanAir Flight from Cvg has been delayed and preponed without any notification üòì
@AmericanAir All that's left is preferred and main cabin extra, I just cant comprehend why we werent put together when I checked in and the seats were there. I'm disappointed.
@AmericanAir I can‚Äôt find on my confirmation email if I have purchased any check in bags for my trip to Nashville. Can you tell me if I have check in bags for all my flights to and from Nashville or where I can find this information. Thanks #AATeam
@AmericanAir what is your policy regarding passengers who require a seatbelt extender and can‚Äôt use the arm rest?
@AmericanAir sucks and no one should ever fly them again
@AmericanAir I can‚Äôt believe I had to wait over 45 minutes on a line at the Austin airport AND missed my direct flight to NY! I‚Äôm traveling with my pet! This ridiculous! And the attendants are complaining about the long lines. How about working and not talking so much! so angry!
@AmericanAir I left my wallet on Seat 36A of flight AA 1330. Please help me recover my wallet. Thank you.
@AmericanAir How do I go about getting compensation for my jet blue flight that I had to cancel due to the cancelled AA flight due to not enough staff to operate. called 8008433447, they told me to contact Etihad even though cancelled flight was AA. PNR QLSJQL, AA3293 12/31 cancelled
@AmericanAir Happy to be onboard üôåüèæ‚ú®
What‚Äôs crazy is I‚Äôve never flown @AmericanAir but I have THE MOST leg room!!
@AmericanAir is the WORST !! Canceling New Year‚Äôs Eve flights because they had not staffed properly?!! Customer service told me the crew needed to rest &amp; gave me a voucher for food &amp; a dodgy hotel!! Thanks #AmericanAirlines hope your crew is now well rested!!
@AmericanAir app question - my friend and I are on the same reservation, booked under my AAdvantage login. Will they be able to use the app to check in and get their boarding pass or will one of us need to use a paper pass?
6AM flight... Gonna be delayed at least 45 mins waiting for crew. Great job @AmericanAir #flightdelay #GoodMorning
Thanks, @AmericanAir, for the free first class upgrade. Maybe 2020 really is my year ‚ú®
El #capitalismo es el peor de todos los males, dice el socialista mientras mira por #Netflix una pel√≠cula yanqui, y en los cortes comerciales busca vuelos de @AmericanAir en su #laptop
@AmericanAir Checked in, there are plenty of seats left, you couldnt sit me next to my fiancee? Ouch!
@AmericanAir Just be sure to get all of those San Diego bound folks on flight 2288 which was cancelled last night home to their loved ones today. Thank you.
@AmericanAir still no crew after five miserable hours. Huge dissapointment
Thank you @AmericanAir for getting me on my plane home after last nights cancellation. #TravelGods
@AmericanAir So not only is your customer service horrifying, you‚Äôve created a dangerous situation on the aircraft just to make a few bucks.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve carried the same bag on your aircrafts for 10 yrs&amp;today(when I‚Äôm traveling with my child)you decide it‚Äôs too big?!It even fit in trial bin! Not to mention I‚Äôm Priority Pro Platinum&amp;paid for Main cabin extra to ensure my bag got on the flight! Ridiculous!üò°üò°
Welp the couple in the exit row doesn‚Äôt understand English and @AmericanAir let it slide. I hope there‚Äôs not an emergency!!!!!
@AmericanAir So you don‚Äôt think the passengers would have preferred to sit in first class vs. waiting on the employees to grab their bags, crawl over people next to them and move to the front?
@AmericanAir shanon at philly lost and found was a huge help and provided excellent customer service. She definitely deserves to be recognized
New Year‚Äôs Eve #AA193 - new record for us. The annual trip to see the grandparents, usually a 24-27 hours ordeal, this time is taking 53 hours. All courtesy of @AmericanAir Good news, the kids are having a great time. Thinking of this as a great adventure. The parents less üòû
@AmericanAir Thanks for a nice time yesterday. I was flying Dallas(DFW) to Chicago(ORD) via Bentonville(XNA). Both flights were bumpy as the E-175 is smaller, but the service was nice, cabi. Crew were great, and the seats were reasonably comfortable. Cheers guys!
@AmericanAir horrible seats on your 777-300 spent 7 hours from LHR to JFK and back in agony. I'm only 5ft10 but the headrest only came up to my shoulders! Will be a factor next time I book
@AmericanAir At the Chattanooga airport since 4AM. Our flight has been delayed for 2.5 hours and counting because of a broken armrest. A broken armrest on a chair no one is suppose to sit in. Delayed because the maintenance guy is not answering his phone. How is this possible??
@AmericanAir #AAL2386 delayed due to lack of one crew member!?! Also, for cleaning!?! Flight came in last night. Great start to 2020!
@AmericanAir Take a page out of any leadership book at serve your clients first! I just witnessed 3 passengers waiting on available seating and 3 staffers (pilots and other employees get escorted from the back of the plane to first class then passengers to the back. #Hmmm
@AmericanAir Shame on you splitting up my family , while traveling back from Europe with 2 minors having to sit next to strangers and making us so all over the plane ! I think I‚Äôm done with your one world!
@AmericanAir hi there. I'm having an issue with sorting my checked luggage for a flight. It was paid for with a 3rd party but hasn't been applied at your end. I'm in the UK . How can I get it sorted please?
Now that the flight is officially canceled, I get to take 2 flights now instead of a nonstop with the longer one in a middle seat, oh boy! üôÑ @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir get a better system than handing out useless postcards for maintenance issues...better yet invest in planes that actually work...thanks
Delayed and still had to wait for the bridge so we could deplane. @AmericanAir nobody knew we were coming? 6 hr flight......come on!
@AmericanAir took to Twitter as no one on the phone sea to know anything or want to help.
@AmericanAir so you pulled our bags and have left me stranded without enough medication. Not the first time you have done this. You have now lost our bags so I do not have enough medication to get through the day. Are you proud of yourselves?
@AmericanAir once again your awful treatment of disabled passengers astounds me. We got to the airport 5 hours early to explain why my partner and I had to sit together. I'm seizure prone...
Hey @AmericanAir am I able to exchange my paper voucher for an evoucher? Just makes it easier to use
@AmericanAir Just wanted to give a shout out to your DFW team. Flight 784 was cancelled yesterday and the Captain was in constant communication with us before they cancelled the flt and then w/w Maureen at the CS desk on reroute plans. Pls thank them!!!
@AmericanAir Send me a promo code for Vegas and you‚Äôll be top of the list!!!
Ppl that have flown ‚úàÔ∏è Is @AmericanAir a very noticeable difference over Frontier... cuz Frontier is half the price $$$
I‚Äôm always quick to throw @AmericanAir under the bus for their past shortcomings. But the of crew of AA63 deserves a s/o for waiting for the 20 or so passengers caught up in the CDG security breach. Kudos #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir Aggravating boarding in Philly. Staff fought me 3 times to try &amp; bring a breast pump on board. Disappointing staff doesn‚Äôt support moms &amp; makes an already challenging experience harder.I‚Äôm a first class passenger &amp; had me rearrange my carry even though it clearly fit
@AmericanAir Not at all. I stood that long because I watched several attendees allow customers to consolidate their bags and then they serviced them. Not organized. I arrived to the airport too early to be pushed back by lack of flow and organization.
Flight canceled due to crew issues now my whole day is gone trying to get home. Stuck in random cities ... thanks for not functioning in excellence ... crew issues should not impact your passengers ... do better @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir the slowest customer assistance counter in the airport. I will never use this airline again. Been in line 40 minutes!!! Unacceptable!!!!
Doing some clean up on older passwords I used to use on some sites. I really hate companies that still use archaic practices when it comes to password requirements. Looking at you @AmericanAir 16 characters max is ridiculous.
@AmericanAir This lady was so helpful and she has truly helped begin our New Year with Joy and Happiest. Thank you G Khan!!!!!
@AmericanAir with the WORST customer service
@AmericanAir YO!!!! You really need to get your s%!t together!!!! Always having to wait on other planes to move from the gate of arrival, having passengers wait forever. Fix it!!!!!! #onsomebullshit #americanairlinessuck #itsalwaysthesamething
@AmericanAir Happy New Year &amp; thank you for keeping me safe in 2019. Starting 2020 with a transatlantic flight, the first of many this year.
Can @AmericanAir offer me a free ride back home rn?
@AmericanAir 30 mins of breathing toxic fumes on runway at LAX with no gate after being told It would be 10 mins. Did they forget we were coming?
@AmericanAir They gate checked my bag w/ delivery and now it‚Äôs no where to be found along with another passengers stroller
@AmericanAir 20 min delay landing in lax and now another 20 min+ wait for bags. What is the deal!!
@AmericanAir Is that really the answer you give to an ep passenger? Unbelievable
@AmericanAir ...yeah once we land and get in line, which at 0130AM will probably be 1 agent. #SorryNotSorry
@AmericanAir delayed flight due to crew reasons and no help at the counter. I trusted you my family #dissapointment aa2890
Would be cool if @AmericanAir would have hotels ready when we land, the entire plane missed connections...but they won‚Äôt #GoingForGreat
@AmericanAir Thank you I think I just sent you one.. sorry it‚Äôs my first dm.. I haven‚Äôt done much on Twitter.. any help you can provide is awesome! We realize this is a needle in a haystack.. Thank you for the effort!
@AmericanAir I ser yli are not aware of the full situation please time to re read
@AmericanAir Ok, I already sent you DM.
@AmericanAir Thank you I filled out and submitted the form! We are praying and have our fingers crossed.. it was pretty his only Christmas present this year! His other present was our trip to Hawaii.. so he is super crushed.. thank you!!
Fuck @AmericanAir IT S BEEN SINCE 30 DEC IM SUPPOSE TO BE IN LAX AND IM STUCK IN PHOENIX WTF?? FLY CANCELED AND THEN DELAY AND THEN NO SEAT AND THEN PUT ME ON STAND BY LIST BEEN ALL DAY AT AIRPORT NEVER HAD CHANCE TO BE IN ANY FLIGHTS FUCK AMERICAN AIRLINES
@AmericanAir Not eligible for a refund for a flight I never took
@AmericanAir Keep getting told not eligible for a refund
@AmericanAir my connecting flight to Albany boarded 30 min early then told me I couldn‚Äôt get on the flight when the plane was right there. Had 2take an Uber to my brothers air bnb he was staying w his frat brothers, no amount of $$ can save me from this sigma delta kappa beta BS
@AmericanAir, AA stands for Always Apologizing...but no one really means it #DelAAyed
@AmericanAir Really? Because it‚Äôs last call and final boarding. They still don‚Äôt have a seat for me. And they already let standbys and a guy who missed his flight on before me, even though I‚Äôm the one who bought a ticket for this flight.
Our @AmericanAir flight crew on tonight‚Äôs flight 1879 with service from Charlotte to Orlando was great! Very helpful and festive. And I‚Äôm only SLIGHTLY biased thanks to getting the entire can of spicy tomato... ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£
It‚Äôs always a good sign when your flight departs in 20 minutes but they don‚Äôt have a seat open for you yet üòä @AmericanAir
And to add insult to injury, we got one meal voucher, so @AmericanAir wants us to either eat dinner or breakfast! After it was their fault we missed our connection!! Seriously thinking of burning my Advantage membership card.
@AmericanAir So glad to hear it :) I will pass this along. Thank you again for your help. That‚Äôs something that I greatly respect!
@AmericanAir Thank you for the quick response. I will reach out to him. I don't think he it bothered him much...he was just anxious to get back to base. However, the rest of our family was just disappointed that there is no policy in place to help take the financial burden off of the troops.
@AmericanAir The change fee wasn't much, but I'm just disappointed to see your organization charge soldiers to fly back earlier than expected, especially when it's active orders that are making them do it.
@AmericanAir I was forced into paying for a seat on a flight that had literally 8 people on it!! My flight was delayed 5 times and the gate was switched without me even getting an email
@AmericanAir Yesterday evening, my cousin was called back to base for immediate deployment overseas. His flight wasn't until the afternoon, but, since he needed to get back asap, he called to change his flight. However, he was still charged a change fee.
@AmericanAir You don‚Äôt know your employees by first and last names? #thatsconcerning
Yo I love you guys but you‚Äôre better than Dasani on the plane smh @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Thanks for getting me here. That's what really matters.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply. However not helpful since I mentioned how we already know when our luggage will arrive tomrorow. Getting in late because of your delay, all places closed on NYD, so we can‚Äôt even stop to buy our kids toothbrushes. Your company incompetence is annoying
.@AmericanAir why do your flights not have charging ports, television screens OR seat back holders so that we can use our own devices? It‚Äôs 2020 ‚Äî get your shit together.
@AmericanAir I find it hard to believe that when you delay our flight, leaving us with a 2 hour layover, that none of our luggage could make it onto the flight. So now we have to wait, based on your schedule for a tomorrow night delivery on a trip having to buy all new things.
@AmericanAir (update: so far so good, I'm on DM with them...)
We‚Äôve been in Portland for 20 minutes and @AmericanAir just informed my brother that his bag is coming in on a later flight.... ANOTHER reason why you don‚Äôt fly with this fucking airline like really y‚Äôall suck
@AmericanAir 12/18/19 7:53am AA1069 OAK-&gt;PHX; 12/18/19 2:37pm AA556 PHX-&gt;DFW; 12/18/19 8:29pm AA2814 DFW-&gt;EWR
@AmericanAir I need your help! I'm an autistic adult who lost my beloved stuffed animal underseat on one of three connections. I have filed an online claim but have not yet heard back. The flights in question are:
@AmericanAir People, RELAX!!! It‚Äôs a bot account that is auto responding when the handle is tagged.
@AmericanAir nah delta or southwest or i‚Äôm not going üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@AmericanAir is straight. lost my bags multiple times, delaying my flights over and over for no reason and tonight the pilot wouldn‚Äôt let us off the plane because ‚Äúno gates were open‚Äù yet we could other airlines planes going into gates üòÇ
@AmericanAir It was definitely a hassle trying to squeeze by everyone with a baby in tow and I wasn‚Äôt about to bud in front of all the other passengers without audible permission.
@AmericanAir my bags are in dallas, I am in Stillwater. Help
@AmericanAir They made over 100 people stand in line for over an hour just to get to talk to your rep and get help!
@AmericanAir Even though there was a Southwest flight that would get him home!
@AmericanAir Well, I travel fairly frequently and this was the first time that they never announced that passengers traveling with small children could board early. All 4 flights and we were in full view of airline employees.
@AmericanAir Poor airplane maintenance is not acceptable. TWO PLANES in the same day? Seriously? They are sending him to Santa Ana and making him take a BUS home!!!
@AmericanAir Hi there! I had an issue with a miles award when I got to the airport this morning, and neither I or an agent could get through via the phone so I had to purchase a full price same day ticket in order to travel. I was also erroneously charged for a checked bag. Help?
@AmericanAir you stranded my husband in Dallas due to mechanical issues after making him miss his connecting flight for MECHANICAL ISSUES!!!
@AmericanAir Why wasn‚Äôt I told by the pilot or flight crew? Why ???? Why does this happen every single time I get on your airline
@AmericanAir Still waiting for a resolution and having to wait behind an entire canceled flight of people for hotel and food.
In case y‚Äôall are wondering @AmericanAir still has not taken responsibility for my luggage that they damaged a month ago.
@AmericanAir ITS 11:08. I HATE THIS AIRLINE
Honestly at least they gave me a $12 meal card like I would much rather eat $12 or McDonald‚Äôs than be at home right now @AmericanAir you sweethearts
@AmericanAir just got off #2257, I paid extra for FC, no service at all due to ‚Äúturbulence‚Äù but FAs didn‚Äôt even say thank you, make eye contact etc #badservice #trainyouremployees
nothing like landing into Dallas to a canceled flight on the 1st day of the new year... way to go @AmericanAir
Quite the laughable experience tonight at @AmericanAir. So much back and forth of what was actually happening over nearly 4 hours before it‚Äôs finally delayed to tomorrow morning.
@AmericanAir at Bogota Colombia don‚Äôt know what time efficiency is, if I have my boarding pass already why do I need to do an hour long line to drop off my luggage in the same line with people checking in?
Hey @AmericanAir I booked a first class award ticket but the flight was cancelled and I got rebooked in economy. Can you refund the variance in points back for the class change??
@AmericanAir 3 hour delay Dallas to Austin.... had to stay on the plane. Luckily they gave me a slice of bread and a sip of water. Jk just one sip of water.... no bread.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôll be pursuing legal action your customer service line was manned by teletubbies do any adults work for your establishment?
@AmericanAir does anyone that works for your so called company understand that there is a basic principle called customer service ?
@AmericanAir we got serious issues your employees in Dallas Fort Worth offered me and two others the worst flying experience in our lives thanks for the 12$ meal vouchers but I don‚Äôt eat McDonald‚Äôs
@AmericanAir I can only receive calls through whatsapp... 5168845082
@AmericanAir Literally missed our flight by 2 minutes!!! Pretty sure moving us closer to the FRONT as requested over and over would have HELPED.
@AmericanAir I will never understand why you board from the front to the back of a plane. Remember the good old days when the cheap seats were boarded first seems to make more sense...
Wouldn‚Äôt be a trip on @AmericanAir without the delay text! #DelAAYed
love that @AmericanAir delayed my previous flight for those who were connecting but can‚Äôt be bothered to help me catch a flight
@AmericanAir Yea you sensing some frustration because you glitching website robbed me and now I have to wait on a refund that can take a week
So it seems in the entire thread, @AmericanAir‚Äôs only ‚Äúcrime‚Äù (other than the apparent gripe of being charged $1800+ when he could accumulate the necessary miles for less) was responding ùë°ùëúùëú ùëûùë¢ùëñùëêùëòùëôùë¶ to some random person on Twitter. /3
@AmericanAir need to fix this shit dawg üöÆüöÆüò≠üò§
@AmericanAir you‚Äôve redeemed yourself‚Äôs. Never underestimate my Karen again. Happy new year.
TWITTER!! I need to find the guy sitting next to me on my plane today!!!! American Airlines Flight 1635, seat 16D. This is not a joke. @AmericanAir HELP #sadgirlszn
@AmericanAir And missing parts of family events...really disappointing
@AmericanAir Landed and Bags finally coming out. This was my second delay in under a week in which a maintenance issue required an equipment swap, a major delay, and having to completely rearrange airport transportation plans.
@AmericanAir Would appreciate a follow up once reviewed. It‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult to justify paying a premium for tickets to maintain an Elite status when customer service continues to tank post the merger.
Shoutout to @AmericanAir for getting me on the next flight to Phoenix tonight though!
Apparently, you no longer get priority boarding while traveling with an infant on @AmericanAir What‚Äôs up with that? #lame
@AmericanAir - Veronica Ligonde at DFW gave us literally the best experience we‚Äôve ever had. Way to hire incredible employees!
@AmericanAir Just DMed you. Thank you
@AmericanAir how do I get a refund on seats I purchased or moved for free on my new flights when it was an issue caused by American that I had to changed to new flights? Now in middle seats which I paid on my other flights not to be in
@AmericanAir What‚Äôs the point in paying for the WiFi if nothing works?
@AmericanAir Interesting - that is not the reason the pilot or customer service reps in London gave us.
@AmericanAir We are the customer.. I just messaged you.
Ugh @AmericanAir did you seriously deliver my sister's lost luggage at 11pm on New Year's Eve? After telling her to wait home for delivery between 4 and 8pm? Ruined her holiday plans, and that poor driver! Do better.
@AmericanAir Made it to KC flight!
@AmericanAir Update:. I arrived at terminal 3 and proceeded to baggage claim like I was told. Find out my bag is in Terminal 5. How the fuck is this airline in business?? There has been ZERO communication throughout this whole fuck up.
@AmericanAir Not to mention the fact that because of your broken planes my wife is missing work tomorrow.
@AmericanAir hiya and happy new year! Just sent a DM!
@AmericanAir It's ok. I love dealing with gate agents that don't know how to rebook flights and your representatives being extremely unhelpful and disrespectful
@AmericanAir This was not a delay it was the first flight at JFK 630am this morning heading to DC as a final destination to Chattanooga.
@AmericanAir Flight delay leaving LA to DFW. Please tell me I will make my connection to KCI!
@AmericanAir We‚Äôve landed but are not yet at the gate
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm checking in at DFW Airport and one of your associates ruined my night, by far the rudest person I‚Äôve encountered in a while. I know what customer service is and that wasn‚Äôt it !!!!I‚Äôll be emailing you shortly!
@AmericanAir how can you justify closing a gate 20 minutes before departure when you‚Äôre tracking late connections? Arrived at MIA from MCO with 25 minutes to spare only to find my MIA to MSY gate closed. Bumped 2.5 hours later and lost my first class seat. Unbelievable.
@AmericanAir ‚Äî thank you for keeping us on the plane/tarmac for three hours on flight from DALLAS to Austin.... you realize we all could have driven to Austin in This amount of time right??? Happy New Year.. üòê
Thanks @AmericanAir for being the worst. I rly planned on spending New Year‚Äôs Day in Philly
Please please help me out @AmericanAir my trip is Jan 5th
@AmericanAir I am a silly unseasoned traveler and made a big boo boo. I booked a flight too close to the departure time of a cruise that was gifted to me, now I am having major anxiety of delays. Called into customer care and they said they couldn‚Äôt help me change to one earlier.
@AmericanAir imagine our surprise today when after boarding a fully booked flight, your plane's door broke and we don't get to go home. It does make me wonder if the maintenance on your doors is so bad, how good is the maintenance on your engines? An extra day of travel. Yay.
@AmericanAir your planes and incompetant assistants suck. Today this is the second plane we are boarding and deboarding due to last min maintanence and engine issues. Already had a terrible customer care assist and a huge turbulance. Not the way i imagined my 1st day of 2020. Tnx
@AmericanAir Booked a basic economy flight by mistake and called to PAY to upgrade my ticket today. AA rep: ‚ÄúMam, this is a live and learn situation. I can‚Äôt help you‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As a travel industry professional with AA Gold status, I‚Äôm considering taking my loyalty elsewhere. ‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir our flight to DFW from SAT is late and somehow the gate agent can't move us closer to the front bc the only seats are main cabin. So instead of waiving the costs of the seats, AA would rather risk paying for my hotel in Dallas after we miss our flight?
I wonder if I will every fly @AmericanAir without them fucking up
@AmericanAir You still haven't explained why it covers Canada but not Mexico.
@AmericanAir hi! Flying tomorrow and have attempted to check in online- have filled out the day of travel info request and saved but can‚Äôt tick the box to check in and then once again says I feel to fill out the day of travel info- can anyone help please ? üëèüèªüò≠
@AmericanAir So Canada is covered but not Mexico
@AmericanAir I am not against that people travel with their lovely pets. I am against that their right to travel comfortable and happy undermines my right to have the same travel experience.
@AmericanAir Not on AA 109 this morning! Onboard entertainment was not working, crew couldn‚Äôt even play the videos for takeoff and landing. And I paid for wi-fi that I could not even use!
@AmericanAir I missed reaching Platinum Executive by $880. Can I send a check?
@AmericanAir Why not complimentary bag to Mexico?
Here's the response from American Airlines. "I am sorry to hear you were unaware that the credit card terms does not cover baggage to Mexico. We certainly understand how important this benefit is." Apparently the don't @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Help me understand why your staff (Three Hispanic ladies) at the baggage transit belt at Chicago O‚ÄôHare International are purposely selecting those they want to assist first based off what I believe to be racial bias. This happened at 18:30. Never flying AA again!üëåüèΩ
@AmericanAir Ha! I‚Äôd be weary even if the flight was free. But lol you only give 10k miles when you mess up.
@AmericanAir Fortunately it got resolved. Frustrating but not the end of the world.
@AmericanAir You‚Äôve left me not wanting to use your airline in future. So I‚Äôd work on that for 2020!
@AmericanAir on the not so great side AA50 is very delayed n I will certainly miss my connection to Amsterdam. Not all great in 2020. It is what it is.
@AmericanAir Thanks for answering, I just sent you more DMs in need of more help!
@AmericanAir worst airline ever - left LAX late to Lihue, was told almost 1/2 way to Kauai that we have to return due to a bad back up system. We were almost half way there! It was the same distance back!Now on new flight they can‚Äôt figure out the passenger count. Back to gate.
There is no advantage to having the AAdvantage card. American Airlines does not give you the free bag when you fly to Mexico. Don't waste your money on the card or the airline. I will be canceling the card @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir lost my luggage and that‚Äôs how my year started üôÉüôÉ
@AmericanAir You‚Äôre seriously ok with this lame response?
@AmericanAir I rather not. You already ruined my departure. Now my return too!! And your customer service and compensation is trash!
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs not about how understanding I am. It‚Äôs about how you treat your customers and look out for them. I took American bc of my family‚Äôs miles but will not go out of my way to purchase from you next time.
@AmericanAir The frustrating part of this experience is that there was no attempt to figure out how to deal with the connecting flights that would be missed. No apology.
@AmericanAir HDSPP me documentaron mi maleta porque seg√∫n no hab√≠a espacio y si hay. Mi escala de un mont√≥n de horas no les agradece esto.
I know travel is unpredictable. But all the time so @AmericanAir has to disappoint? I just wanna get home.
@AmericanAir always delayed, lose/leave my luggage, leave us sitting on the tarmac for 30 minutes waiting on a gate. Every single time
Thank you @AmericanAir for the great New Year‚Äôs Day flight home, no delays!
@AmericanAir I just sent you a DM, can you please check it out?
@AmericanAir Even his announcement about our cruising altitude was humorous. You‚Äôre right. Captain Leisten is a #rockstAAr, and he‚Äôs most deserving of your company‚Äôs highest accolades.
@AmericanAir thank you for losing my bag and for the worst service ever to find it. #worstserviceever !
honestly every single time i fly @AmericanAir something always goes wrongü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #neveragain
Okay, we're about to take another swing at CLT-BTV on @AmericanAir #5479 maybe we make it this time! (thanks for the sandwiches)
Why does @AmericanAir always have passengers sitting wondering wtf is going on and when we leaving. Update ppl dammit.
@AmericanAir it is unfair! I don‚Äôt tolerate dogs‚Äô smell. I am allergic to dogs and I don‚Äôt like them. I am forced to travel close to one dog because the flight attendant refused to change me!! Do I have fewer rights that the passengers that flights with dogs???
@AmericanAir Again-pay the extra expense AA created or cancel our vacation-Sad to see this kind of customer service from AA. Luckily this is not the policy of many US airlines like JetBlue (and is against the law in the EU) - we will be spreading the word on this short sighted policy
PS - I was in the air on your partner @AmericanAir flight when you cancelled my connection, a text saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a change with your reservation‚Äù when you already have my luggage really doesn‚Äôt cut it
@AmericanAir Please do. I was just informed again that my bag is no longer your issue and there was no one I could talk to to resolve my concern. Oh and that social media is not reality.
@AmericanAir They‚Äôre saying there is no crew so our flight will most likely be delayed for tomorrow. What can I do? My flight is to Phoenix but my destination is Portland Oregon, can I get a flight with a different connection?
@AmericanAir The free seats you offer are not next to each other. The free seats put us opposites sides of the plane. Aisle and window seats shouldn‚Äôt be preferred seats, like other airlines. By making them preferred seats, you require your customers to pay to sit next to their families
Ryan @AmericanAir unbelievable...bullying and being rude to elderly women. Never seen such rude and disrespectful treatment from an airline. #neveragain #americanairlines
@AmericanAir frustrated to pay ¬£65 for a ‚Äòpreferred‚Äô seat, so I can sit next to my wife. There‚Äôs seats available together, this is a moneymaking scheme. Very poor way to finish off our honeymoon, I thought AA had a better reputation than to play these low budget airline games.
@AmericanAir I was traveling with my toddler Monday from BOS to DFW and left my iPad in my seat in the struggle to keep her from running away. I filed a claim but haven‚Äôt heard anything. Please help! So many baby pictures on that iPad!!
@AmericanAir you guys are stinky and suck
@AmericanAir change your slogan to ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt care at all‚Äù üíØ it‚Äôll fit your quality of service way better.
@AmericanAir So you never answered the question...does it burn more fuel with heat on? We are dressed for Hawaii but the cabin the entire flight is maybe 60‚Äôs. People had scarves, used napkins, &amp; anything else they could find to stay warm. Why? Cut cost? Don‚Äôt care about passengers, or both?
. @AmericanAir my flight got delayed 3 hours because your planes don‚Äôt work and now I have a 9-minute layover or I miss the last flight to DC. can I have 100 free Biscoff cookies
Look no further because @AmericanAir is the airline FOR YOU! This all happened to my mom today. On top of all of that they treated my mom poorly and wouldn‚Äôt even give her a refund after they tagged her luggage wrong. Now her luggage is Mexico and she‚Äôs away with nothing.
How does @AmericanAir not have a single representative working at ECP right now?
@AmericanAir is there any other actions that can be taken. this is unacceptable. planes should be checked thoroughly after each flight
@AmericanAir‚Äôs level of service today has been absolutely reprehensible and I am 100% dissatisfied with it
@AmericanAir cancelled our flight today and offered the poorest customer service I have ever experienced with an airline
@AmericanAir cancelled our flight today and gave us zero options or itineraries that got us in the air in less than 24 hours
@AmericanAir cancelled our flight today and gave us zero options or alternate itineraries out of the airport we were at
@AmericanAir cancelled our flight today and then gave us absolutely zero options or alternate itineraries that didn‚Äôt cost us over a thousand dollars
10 hours between LHR and LAX with no on-board entertainment! @AmericanAir really needs to do better.
My flight is delayed by 4 hours.... this is my first and last time flying with @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir I definitely will after I drive 2 hours to my house. #CustomerService #joke
@AmericanAir Thx for the reply. I got it taken care of. Leaving tomorrow now. Scary way to start out the new decade though
Starting out 2020 with @AmericanAir losing both my bags en route to Australia üòë
@AmericanAir my flight was delayed 3 hours in an airport that was closed! I will never use this airline again due to the terrible customer service
@AmericanAir This is not true. The benefits that AA provides are nothing. You are always manipulating the upgrades and awards.
@AmericanAir today is the second time that my AA2580 have been delayed waiting for flight attendants at JFK. No weather issue. I wonder why a major airline at one of the largest airport in the US cannot perform a better scheduling of their employees.
@AmericanAir But you‚Äôd rather extra leg room seats go empty than actually see customers comfortable
@AmericanAir Also, I called the 800 baggage help number and they were ZERO help. They pretty much just said we all have to wait in this line. Why even have a call center for baggage then? Way to leave a good employee hanging.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the help. You guys have been a real gem to deal with the past two days trying to get home from a flight you cancelled
@AmericanAir First flight delayed 15 hours, only to board and then be told it‚Äôs cancelled. Second and third flights delayed. Not good enough
@AmericanAir here at Colorado Springs airport. I would like to applaud the customer service rep at the baggage claim desk who is doing a great job of helping people. But she has a line going back to the baggage carousel. Could she get more help?!? Havent moved a foot in 15 min...
@AmericanAir Ah, thanks for not even ready my tweets!!!
@AmericanAir What exactly are you doing to help with that? I can‚Äôt get connected with a live person and my file number isn‚Äôt working on your site. If you told me exactly how you are trying to help I might believe you but your response is too vague for me
Shout out to the rebooking team at @AmericanAir MIA gate D37. You were so helpful getting our family of 5 to our vacation destination after delay/missed flight. Thank you for taking good care of us.
@AmericanAir Always is a nightmare the way that AA is managing upgrades. A lot of benefits, that you cannot use it. As CK very disappointing.
@AmericanAir Not happening anytime soon captain just said to many planes and not enough gates at LAX üëçüèøüëçüèøHe speaks the truth
On my third airplane today just desparately trying to make it back to Chicago. Thanks @AmericanAir for consistently not knowing where my bag is and making this entire day stressful! I will be SHOCKED if my bag makes it to O'Hare since I barely am. #NeverTravelWithAmerican
@AmericanAir Thank you, will keep you posted! So far, we are still at the gate.
Hey @AmericanAir I super love it when your flight attendents tell me ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt belong here‚Äù and then move my entire family around the plane despite our boarding pass seat assignments indicating we are in the correct place üôÉ
@AmericanAir I will be in contact for compensation. Started with my valeted bag claim check given to wrong passenger &amp; now a 3 hour delay. I paid $600 for this mess! #CustomerService
@AmericanAir Luckily your staff are better than silly corporate policies. I brought all bags on board with no issue. Happy new year. Best of luck to your stock prices in 2020.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the heads up that you'll happily strand me at a regional airport and force me to spend hundreds more to get home, though! Now I know not to fly American ever again. Absolute garbage.
@AmericanAir AA1161 leave BOS late for a broken plane, arrive LAX to no gate available, really love sitting on a plane with no entertainment or power to charge devices
@AmericanAir while traveling this holiday season I must share that your DFW gate agents are very rude. They don't welcome, acknowledge or address you in any way. We found the agents in the other states we visited were always friendly and spoke with us, but never at DFW.
@AmericanAir There literally wasn't another way home. You had no other flights out of EGE, and you weren't providing a shuttle to DIA for the alternate. So what, they just live in EGE now or pay $600 out of pocket to get to the other flight? Unbelievable.
@AmericanAir Also wondering what will be done to compensate passengers for this incredibly uncomfortable and stressful reroute/delay that was so poorly communicated?
@AmericanAir well you‚Äôve been nothing but unhelpful and my bag is still lost. This is the worst customer service I have ever received
@AmericanAir can you help me apply a few SWUs?
@AmericanAir Thank you, 9+ hours is way too long to not have access to food!
@AmericanAir I left my leather quilted jacket in the overhead bin on flight 103 PHL PHXon12/31. I was seated in 30F
@AmericanAir My flight was delayed due to a staffing shortage and I missed my connecting flight in Nashville. Now I have a 4 hour delay getting home to LGA and I have an additional layover.
@AmericanAir hey just wanna let you know if you didn‚Äôt already, yous fucking suck.. literally every single one of you. You have a flight that was supposed to be direct to Philadelphia but some how we‚Äôre in Miami.... FUCK YOUS
@AmericanAir you guys rebooked me üôÉ
@AmericanAir They updated us that they were not able to obtain that food. Can you change this? We also definitely are not leaving at 640 as we are still at the gate and missing a second pilot
Worst airline award goes to @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir We got the claim filed thank you
@AmericanAir your flight cancellations out of EGE today forced my friends to pay $595 to rent a car to drive all the way to Denver for the alternate flight because you had no others out of EGE. You're gonna reimburse that, right? Delta's flights managed to depart.
@AmericanAir we are stuck in customs and our flight leaves in 45 minutes. Can you help? Flight 2520 from DFW to ORD
Hey @AmericanAir you should have more than one person helping get boarding passes out on a big time holiday. I don‚Äôt understand the logic here. One person in the El Paso airport for a huge line starting down the concourse -_- #annoyed
@AmericanAir delayed headed to DFW and then delayed going to BHM. We can‚Äôt catch a break.
@AmericanAir If Alaska Air can guarantee bags within 20 minutes you have to do better than an hour for bags. That‚Äôs more than a little behind.
Seated on the plane with boarding complete and the flight attendant comes to tell me I‚Äôve been upgraded. 2020 is off to a nice start! @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Actually longer than 9 hours since leaving here at 6:40 is even later than we were initially told.
@AmericanAir What about the food? We were told when we boarded that the layover would involved deplaning, so we have nothing to eat. Including the boarding process and the deplaning/customs we will have gone over 8 hours without any food.
@AmericanAir It wasn‚Äôt due to weather. It was mechanical and then this am it was bad communications to passengers
@AmericanAir Ok I have it now. Thanks
@AmericanAir Why is it taking an hour to get the bags for flight 688 in PHL? Two flights that landed after us have had bags arrive.
@AmericanAir I'm currently on AA175 from DFW to Narita and informed over Vancouver we are returning to dfw due to a maintenance paperwork issue. I am connecting thru to Hanoi. How will this be handled and rebooked? It's a full flight so unsure how everyone will be accommodated.
Hey @AmericanAir Flight 2754 landed DFW at 3:45. Took a short trip to the gate arriving at 3:55. 35 min later still awaiting our luggage. Ridiculous!
@AmericanAir pls explain to me how a 3hr direct flight turns into a 6.5hr flight with an unplanned layover during which we can not leave the plane, and no on board food service #aa790
@AmericanAir That seems unfair that I just flew last month but that doesn‚Äôt count now?
@AmericanAir yep another issue. This has been the worst passenger experience in 1 trip. #CustomerService
@AmericanAir Two flights delayed in one day AND one of bags didn‚Äôt make it! Please fix this.
Hey @AmericanAir, why does my flight keep getting delayed? 6 and counting...
@AmericanAir With a4 month old and a three year old it's difficult to find a team member at closing time.
@AmericanAir Hi we are trying to add bags to an already booked flight and your website will not give us the option to??? Please help!!!
Thanks @AmericanAir for featuring Woody Allan's "A Rainy Day in New York" on board! I look forward to watching it on my flight from LA to Chicago later this month. That movie is impossible to watch anywhere else RN.
@AmericanAir Thank you for your prompt response. I‚Äôll watch for your DM
@AmericanAir you guys are the only company in the world that would not allow paying customers for business class upgrades....like, what? Either you have too much money or you don't like money at all
@AmericanAir You have no idea what plane I‚Äôm on
Airlines get such a bad rap. Thanks, @AmericanAir for your help changing my reservation
@AmericanAir is there reduced flight capacity today from ORD-LGA? It seems like more and more NYC routes from ORD keep getting cut (JFK being almost abandoned now). I wish you shifted more routes to Chicago, instead of a 2nd tier city like PHL. #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir All because you couldn‚Äôt get a #crew for a 9am #flight
Love the efficiency when calling the @AmericanAir special assistance desk. Took care of adding my guide dog and securing a seat assignment for an upcoming trip to Texas in about 2 minutes.
@AmericanAir thank u for ruining my new years
@AmericanAir Please bring back nonstop service between LAX and PIT!!
@AmericanAir I just spotted another mistake: the "or" in "Laptop or handbag" is translated into "laptop ofr handtas". It should be "Laptop of handtas". Any chance you're looking for translators? üòÖ
@AmericanAir 4 flights this holiday season, each one delayed. Nice way to start the year.
.@AmericanAir ur flight attendant spilled coffee on me and said better on the f*g than a human....WTF?????? i demand a free flight
Shout-out to the @AmericanAir customer service team for getting me rebooked on a later flight tonight so promptly. Not ideal but I appreciate the hustle. üôèüèª‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir will not let Dom and I sit together unless we pay them an additional $20 on top of our ticket price. We also board last. Aisle seats cost more than window seats, which cost more than middle seats. Flying is not the same anymore...
@AmericanAir I don‚Äôt want to think its because I‚Äôm a woman. Discriminatory while other people with larger bags were able to go. Again my two minors were instructed to go WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER. DISCRIMINATION #HISPANIC
@AmericanAir has me stranded in San Diego
@AmericanAir your people at Charlotte (boarding people) are horrible. They take carry ons smaller than those in the actual passenger area. Your people stopped me while my row minors were instructed toGOOOOOO ! Horrible !
.@AmericanAir Actual trash. Still waiting on a problem to be fixed when the plan has been sitting at the gate for 2 hours prior to our departure.
@AmericanAir thanks for putting a bag I absolutely needed onto a later flight and can‚Äôt get till tomorrow. So trash. I had a two hour layover and you drop the ball like that?
The poor level of customer service that @AmericanAir has exhibited today makes me NEVER want to use them again. #americanairlinesSUCKS
@AmericanAir going to miss connection due to plane mechanical issue after takeoff how can I move my flight?
@AmericanAir due to a cancelled flight on 12/24 aka Christmas Eve night, ‚Äúyou can rent a car‚Äù per your team in order to get to our destination was a useless ‚Äúoption.‚Äù O‚ÄôHare had sold out of rentals and local branches were closed due to the holiday...
@AmericanAir is the worst flight I‚Äôve taken !! Once while Prego and just 2 days ago. I hope yaw go bankrupt
@AmericanAir last 22/12 in flight AA37 got me 6 HOURS on a plane without taking off and then told us the flight was cancelled because wether conditions
@AmericanAir Your placatory tweet isn't really going to help.
@AmericanAir what‚Äôs going on with flight 5969 from DFW to ECP??? departure time has changed to 4:16PM on Jan 1 from gate B36 in terminal B. #3rddelay #americanairlines
Okay but why is the cinematography in the @AmericanAir safety video actually really good??
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm running out of meds and I have a medical procedure 8am tomorrow! I was supposed to be home at 11am THIS MORNING!!! APOLOGIES DONT MEAM SHIT!
When the lady working @AmericanAir STL customer help desk makes an exaggerated and annoyed eyeroll at a polite customer asking a flight question... hope that‚Äôs not indicative of how I‚Äôll be treated too! #CustomerService #commoncourtesy
Hi there @AmericanAir, can you please help me? I bought premium seats for a flight, but the flight was cancelled. So I asked for a refund. The flight had 2 legs (one connection) and I only got refunded for one of the legs. Can you help me be refunded for the other leg please?
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm having trouble with a standby flight. Can you help me understand why I was called for standby and the other party on my reservation wasn‚Äôt? We couldn‚Äôt get on the flight despite three more standbys being cleared after. We booked and checked in at the same time.
Most airline tweets are bitching/complaining. That narrative is extremely skewed. Quick s/o to @AmericanAir for the excellent job today. These guys don't get the credit they deserve #MoreLoveLessHate
It's super great that our @AmericanAir flight was already delayed by half an hour and now the plane is "overfueled" (seriously, WHAT?) and it will take another 45 minutes to de-fuel it.
Great @AmericanAir flight to #palmsprings. But we‚Äôve been waiting forever to get off the plane cause the jetbridge isn‚Äôt working üôÑand the crew can‚Äôt communicate with the peeps on the ground.
@AmericanAir Didnt even want to acknowledge how they had previously let others check bags for free. Basically betrated her. At Sky Harbor airport.
@AmericanAir They kept announcing that anyone could check a bag for free at the gate. When my sister was boarding they demanded her bag was too big to be a carry-on and forced her to pay. Her bag is a carry on on any other airline. And you never argue and yell at a guest, you apologize. They
happy new year @AmericanAir! i‚Äôm currently grounded at LGA and going to miss my connecting flight in columbus for a maintenance issue. please tell me you can get me home to phoenix tonight? üò≠
@AmericanAir can you tell me why the GSO to DFW flight 5725 keeps getting delayed? Is it a plane function? Our connection in Dallas is at 10:35pm and I‚Äôm getting worried we might miss it now.
@AmericanAir that's funny. All the united flights from Chicago to Memphis made it and on time too. Weather must have been better at the United gate vs the American gate. But since it's always weather at least you dont have to pay compensation.
my boyfriend was set to arrive at GSP this morning but after two unexpected layovers and several hours of waiting he won‚Äôt be back in town until after 5 PM. @AmericanAir never seems to fail at failing their customers.
@AmericanAir People are quick to complain... it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the good as well. Happy New Year!üéÜ
@AmericanAir What‚Äôs up with the website to purchase miles? I keep getting a message that ‚Äúit has taken flight‚Äù. :(
New Year's Resolution to stop spending money with @AmericanAir Nothing but frustration every time I fly with them. Over it. Life is too short.
24 hrs to get from Memphis to Chicago is a tad bit too long @AmericanAir :(
@AmericanAir flight 4029 has probably the rudest flight attendant I‚Äôve ever experienced.
Not the way I was hoping to start 2020 @AmericanAir! Flight delayed for maintenance issues for almost 3 hours now. You would assume they would have a better Operations team to re-work things or deploy a spare. Sigh
Been on the ground at DFW for 30 minutes now ..any chance I could get my bag? @AmericanAir
And before I forget CHAREZ TINKER is the best flight attendant I‚Äôve ever had @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Not buying it with ALL of the other airlines landing safely in EGE. Maybe your pilots need more training.
@AmericanAir Not acceptable. I'm in the US.
@AmericanAir Unbelievable! Left my iPad in pocket of a first class international flight. Reported immediately. Still no response from AA.
@AmericanAir I purchased my flight on Dec 6 and I still haven‚Äôt gotten any type of confirmation or receipt...I called and only got info for the flight in general
So frustrated with @AmericanAir our first flight was delayed an hour for unknown reasons, which made us miss our connecting gate closure time (the plane was still there) So we had to wait in the airport ALL DAY only to find out that our new flight is now delayed!
@AmericanAir My travel day today... 1675 delayed by 90 mins - no flight crew. 5660 missed due to earlier delay. 4819 delayed by 30 mins+ - no flight crew yet again.... still on the ground. Thanks AA for losing me my day... Happy New Year... NOT! Where are your crews today?
@AmericanAir They have not. I‚Äôve emailed them back multiple times.
I‚Äôm getting on a jank ass airplane that delayed us for 5 hours due to ‚Äúmaintenance issues‚Äù. If it goes down in flames I want everyone to know it was @AmericanAir to Dallas and also Bassnector 360 was sick as fuck.
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines could you please respond?
.@AmericanAir your airline is literally trash. Been stuck in OHare with no updates. Flight 2989. Front desk attendant says ‚Äústill no update‚Äù. Literally just waiting at the gate. Pathetic.
I thought April fools day was 4/1, not 1/1!!!! @AmericanAir told us our options for diverted flight 3087 we‚Äôre to go back to LA and not our final destination of aspen when we‚Äôre sitting in Denver
One more thing... If this story is true then none of the circumstances are the fault of @AmericanAir. If anything they should be commended for accepting a passenger for an international flight without proper documentation. Most airlines would without exception deny boarding.
@AmericanAir All we get to compensate was $12 meal vouchers?? Disgraceful.
@AmericanAir arrived in CLT we were told that we were not booked on that flight and had to fly standby. That was a full flight to PVD. So now we have to fly into PHL, wait 2 hours and then fly into PVD; getting us there at 11:15. Ten hours later then we were supposed to get in.
@AmericanAir hello. our flight from MIA to CLT was delayed, causing our family to miss our connecting flight to PVD. All because one of your flight attendants didn‚Äôt show up. Following this we were told that we were rebooked on a later flight to PVD out of CLT. However when we
@AmericanAir hey AA, a huge nasty storm is going to come through SLC tonight. I am in the late flight out. Any anticipation of the storm and intent to move passengers to earlier flights?
@AmericanAir flight 3087 was diverted to Denver. No way of getting to aspen. Was told by customer service the best option is to go back to Los Angeles!!! Wtf!!!!!
@AmericanAir short a flight attendant, and we‚Äôre 14 hours and 52 minutes into the new year. 2020 looking a lot like 2019. #typical
@AmericanAir In little rock she had to find her own way to Memphis. Plus her bag was sent somewhere else and she now is waiting for it. Never again.
@AmericanAir ok so you got one more chance. Daughter in law flew dec.31 GRD to ORD During her flight you canceled her connecting flight from ORD to MEM. only options you gave were spent the night in Chicago but pay for her own hotel or fly to little rock 2 hrs from final.
I was having issues with my card at the airport so i couldn‚Äôt pay for my baggage...the supervisor sent it through for free and i am sobbing thank you @AmericanAir ilysm
AA3087. We are not at the gate in Denver. Sitting without food or water on the plane. @AmericanAir please step up and do the right thing by getting us customers to our final destination of ASPEN.
@AmericanAir Now we have to get a $200 plus shuttle to EGE and arrive 8 hours past our scheduled time. Absolutely unacceptable!
@AmericanAir we have no way of getting to aspen. American will not help us get there.
Flight 3087. LAX to ASE. @AmericanAir we cannot get off the plane after being diverted due to no gate availability at DIA. Then we are told that we can go back to LA OR find our own way to aspen? I thought April fools was on April 1 not January 1!!!!!
@AmericanAir water is being limited to passengers to avoid causing ‚Äúlong bathroom lines‚Äù since we are on an active runway. Flight 3087. Horrible customer service today. Happy 2020 right?!
@AmericanAir I get that, but in 5 months I had over 20 flights and $3K in qualifying dollars... Should be a rolling year until you qualify. After that, I get the expire on the calendar year.
Flight 3087 @AmericanAir you need to help us customers find a REASONABLE way to get to our final destination. There is a minor traveling without an adult on this flight.
@AmericanAir paid a premium to fly into aspen now American Airlines is not willing to help customers actually get there. Stuck at Denver airport but we can‚Äôt even get off the airplane because there are no gates available
@AmericanAir STUCK ON TARMACK AT DIA. Flight 3087. Diverted from aspen. We can‚Äôt get a gate. People are PISSSSSSED that American won‚Äôt help customers get to Aspen!!! It‚Äôs a 4 hour drive
@AmericanAir your elevators in terminal B by food court are not safe. They‚Äôre shaking &amp; don‚Äôt stop on the floors you push. A porter just told me you couldn‚Äôt give him $100 to ride those dangerous elevators! #shame
Hello @AmericanAir can you tell us if Fl 685 has WiFi?
Why is @AmericanAir trying to make me spend my miles or $ to upgrade from Platinum to Platinum Pro #frequentflyer which gives little benefit now they split their 3 levels into 4. As I am Platinum for life I was really annoyed when they made that change and now they rub it in!
@AmericanAir I filed a report immediately via that phone number. However, hopes of retrieving my missing Avenue sling bag are bleak considering the circumstances. It‚Äôs very unfortunate that I pay to check my baggage just to get robbed
Hi @AmericanAir I just want to let you know that Monica and the other ladies in the PIT Admirals Club are outstanding! Monica went above and beyond getting my upgrade set. These ladies are a huge asset to #AmericanAirlines #travel #cruise #airline #airtravel üõ´üóΩüêÉüõ≥
I am about to attempt to bring four ‚Äòcarry on‚Äô bags and one ‚Äòpersonal item‚Äô on my flight that permits only one of each. There may be some crying at the @AmericanAir counter, but I trust them to honour the spirit of the holiday season and #BeBest.
@AmericanAir I could get better customer on a deserted island
para q dicen WIFI GRATIS si cuando uno ingresa dice qu√© hay que pagar 12 d√≥lares la hora üôÇ¬ø¬ø? @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir Your site has been hacked. It's showing the German flag.
Boarded plane on time. Let‚Äôs see if @AmericanAir can start 2020 on schedule
@AmericanAir Please do they were Awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
@AmericanAir Wow. The most tone deaf tweet of the year. May 2020 bring you unemployment.
How long does it take for @AmericanAir workers to bring bags down to Baggage Claim at LAX smh!
It‚Äôs my First time flying with @AmericanAir and I highly do not recommend it!! Their staff is so incredibly rude and have such nasty attitudes. They‚Äôve also pushed back departure time 4x already!! I‚Äôve never seen such and unprofessional airline.
@AmericanAir is a nightmare. Mechanical malfunction on one flight causing me to miss my connecting international flight, and we can‚Äôt get on anything until tomorrow? So I‚Äôm losing time and money and a whole day on a trip I‚Äôve planned for months. Awesome
@AmericanAir I sent you a DM
@AmericanAir arrived late but check in was ok. Not right for 1st class Intl to Wait 4 economy priority pax. MCO admirals club just exquisite Cheri was magical, M. Garcia knew me n address by name. Adaan bartender great CS n friendly. Love the MCO Admirals. Now on AA 2538 to DFW.
Note to @AmericanAir - been a loyal member for years and your mileage redemption program is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen...so much so I ended up booking with another airline maybe a permanent move...you can do better
@AmericanAir My flight 1417 from Ohare to Cancun on January 16 is at 7:30am. Do I need to be at the airport at 4:30 when it‚Äôs that early in the morning?
25 minutes waiting to pushback. C‚Äômon @AmericanAir, get your act together in Charlotte.
@AmericanAir I have rebooked after such an hassle. Saying apology nowadays does not mean anything these days. What about plans I had in Chicago or now have to ask someone for a night stay. Shuffling and rearranging schedule.
@AmericanAir AA1309 this morning. Erin was very friendly and helpful. Send her my thanks from 16B!
Lol can you imagine being such a bitch you made THE POPE so angry he fucking slapped you? I‚Äôll bet she flies @AmericanAir too.
@AmericanAir bigger problems ‚úàÔ∏è our flight was diverted to Denver from EGE. What now??
Great way to start off 2020... @AmericanAir my flight has been delayed for over 30 minutes without being notified; Reason: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a Flight Attendant...‚Äù I travel a bunch for work and this happens on my vacation!? I hope I make my connecting flight!!!
@AmericanAir took a flight from dfw to fra on Dec 5, can you please have the flight attendant speak in a softer tone, some came off rude or is that the American airline standards?
@AmericanAir Not with a typo and horrible customer service ü•¥
@AmericanAir unless you all plan to reimburse me . I‚Äôm going to ensure that everyone on my flight is uncomfortable and afraid the entire journey . This is nonsense.
@AmericanAir why was my flight delayed three times and now I‚Äôm missing my connecting flight .
@AmericanAir great service over the holidays . We didn‚Äôt experience any delays and your flights are updates well! . Thank for making flying a great experience and happy new year to you all.
@AmericanAir I know last night was NYE but I was able to get to the airport on time this morning. Where is the flight attendant we‚Äôve been waiting on?
@AmericanAir Can you fly to Singapore and to more places from the USA I hope y‚Äôall will someday
@AmericanAir Dec27 hadfamily emergency. Could not get where I need to be ,but could get family there. TRESSIE I hope I got that right was great getting my family there. Don‚Äôt know who to contact to get her recognized so I hope this tweet works. She answered when I called AA 800
@AmericanAir Happy New year please bring non stop flights from JFK to IAH
@AmericanAir Nah delta hooked me up I switched airlines. Happy new year
I‚Äôm never flying @AmericanAir ever again.
@AmericanAir Happy New Year Team AA! ü•ÇWe are fortunate to be traveling ‚úàÔ∏èFirst Class at the end of January to San Juan on an early morning flight from PHL. Will we be able to use the Admirals Club in the Terminal (gate) A area as an International flight? Thanks!
@AmericanAir hey my birthday coming up I want to fly AA. Is there a promotion code I could use? üò¨
@AmericanAir I'm sure you totally mean that
@AmericanAir AA739 PHX to ORD three announcements every thirty minutes that the plane ‚Äúhas been fixed.‚Äù We‚Äôve been sitting in the plane for almost 2 hours without air or water. Just let us off if you‚Äôre not 100% certain about the safety of the aircraft. #anxious #badservice
@AmericanAir We have a trip planned in April and the 2nd leg of our return was cancelled by AA, forcing us to stay overnight in Miami - support said we can pay for the forced hotel/addl sitter time or cancel our trip. American Air we were expecting more - can nothing be done?
@AmericanAir I was almost to platinum status and now I have to accrue everything to qualify. Is there any way to pay up for the status I was accruing before it got reset?
@AmericanAir You are missing the point. If the seats are empty after the boarding process then why not let someone sit in them rather than keeping the seats empty? Makes NO sense
@AmericanAir please let your passengers off the plane when fixing technical difficulties. Is it really for everyone‚Äôs benefit to keep people in the cabin with no air or water for more than an hour? #theworst #isitreallyfixed #anxious
@AmericanAir if I got upgraded to first class for one of my flights tomorrow, do I get any checked bags for free? Thanks!
@AmericanAir AA Ref#1-28648810506 I have been in correspondence with your Customer Relations since February and keep being told that my account details which I have supplied are wrong when they are not. I do hope you can bring this to a conclusion
Uneventful trip and had the most entertaining captain ever, well done @AmericanAir. Y‚Äôall redeemed yourselves in my book
Starting out the New Year right with @AmericanAir delaying my first flight which will cause me to miss my connection back to Texas and won‚Äôt get back till almost midnight now. Great start thanks AA!
If I miss my connecting flight this will be the 5th time this has happened to me . @AmericanAir
Here we go again. @AmericanAir please don‚Äôt let me down today. I just want to get home. üòî
@AmericanAir Hi. I booked a flight yesterday and never received a confirmation email or receipt. Is this something that can be emailed to me today?
Quick quiz, @AmericanAir. Due to web browser glitch, customer's paid airfare was canceled moments ago. a) Kindly restore original flight plans b) Hold customer's nonrefundable $ hostage, change flights/dates, &amp; charge hundreds in fare difference to avoid "losing money"
@AmericanAir Flight 1060 more than a 2 hour delay because the flight attendants wouldnt show to work. Once again, another delayed flight from #americanairlines... #aa
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm flying home and this is the most unprofessional group of flight attendants I‚Äôve ever dealt with. More information when I land. Flight 1798. Starting 2020 with a group of unhappy customers. Please advise.
@AmericanAir is so RUDE! Flying MIA to CLT stopped to ask for help and the two ladies at the gate wouldn‚Äôt even look up, told me they couldn‚Äôt help me before I even asked my question, then helped the person behind me. Never flying American again #deltaallday #americanairsucks
@AmericanAir DELAYED 3x!!!!! This is not the way to start my new year!!!!!
@AmericanAir dog incessantly barking at gate E28 CLT- what‚Äôs the policy for animals that are disrupting?
Since being FORCED to fly into MIA on Sunday, I still don‚Äôt have my luggage that was on my plane to FLL. @AmericanAir. I‚Äôve been more than patient but at this point, I‚Äôm frustrated.
@AmericanAir ... and that's why I refuse to fly your airline. You are tone deaf
@AmericanAir Thx AA! Just landed safe and sound. Thankful that a team managed to get us wheels up. Have a happy new year!
@AmericanAir do you not have a infants and children board first policy?
@AmericanAir I can be empathetic to weather delays, but your crew can‚Äôt make it to WORK on time on New Year‚Äôs Day.
I live 45 min from the airport; it's inconvenient as hell for a single mom to make that trek with kids in tow. Thanks @AmericanAir for your hospitality
Apparently @AmericanAir pulled a flight attendant from another flight. I wonder if this is code for ‚Äúwe‚Äôre hoping someone shows up‚Äù. What a fantastic start to #2020
I‚Äôm just sitting at an LAX terminal, waiting to board my flight. Apparently an @AmericanAir flight attendant couldn‚Äôt get to the airport on time. We were supposed to depart 12 mins ago.
@AmericanAir You need more agents at the priority counter at MCO. Line is backing up &amp; it‚Äôs taking a really long time.
Everyone please stop flying @AmericanAir Rudest staff ever
My favorite thing about flying @AmericanAir is landing an hour ealry... even better is still having a late arrival time. Sitting on the tarmac for a full hour is peak efficiency I like to see in business
Lets see if I can go a decade without flying @AmericanAir üëÄü§ûüèΩ
@AmericanAir There wasn't any sparkling wine either. And the cabin hadn't been cleaned properly. You just lost the loyalty of this long-time EP customer.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm a veteran active duty Airforce need to change my flight from today to tomorrow
For the first time I'm having a poor experience with @AmericanAir today. We flew on JAL first yesterday and had no problems with our ~60 lb suitcases because the allowance is 70 lbs, yet for the connecting flight home AA made us remove stuff to get to 50 lbs! Unreasonable!
Happy New Year to everyone but @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir if I wanted to fly on a death trap twice my age I would go to a former Soviet country and fly there instead üò§
@AmericanAir can you explain your asinine policy of having gift cards purchased online not being available until 3 days later? Are your computers stuck in the 1980's? I can't think of another company that does it this way....
@AmericanAir Right... still haven‚Äôt left btw
@AmericanAir Bags made it too. 12 hours later than expected but she made it to Rochester!
If @AmericanAir spent as much money as they do keeping track of their delays on new airplanes I might actually enjoy flying with them üôÑ
@AmericanAir Thanks. Pretty cut and dry here. Your staff bailed on our flight home and we‚Äôll be refunded. Seems easy but DM is sent.
@AmericanAir worst airline ever. Split my family up on Christmas due to lack of knowledge on passport needed. Finally let the rest of my family fly after they acknowledged their mistake but by then we already missed Christmas... #AmericanAirlinessucks
Have had the worst experience flying @AmericanAir. You guys can‚Äôt seem to be consistent with anything, are filled with empty promises, and you still can‚Äôt seem to find my luggage after almost 24 hours when I was told it was on the way to me 12 hours ago. Get it together.
It‚Äôs not like @AmericanAir is losing money by letting me sit there - the seats were EMPTY!!! What a stupid policy. (2/2)
Took a flight this morning from HSV to DFW @AmericanAir. Exit row seats in front of us were empty. I asked the flight attendant if I could move to the seat he said no - those are premium seats and he‚Äôs not allowed to do that. What kind of messed up policy that? (1/2)
@AmericanAir Can you share where they're coming from?
This plane makes the same sounds as my car, thanks @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir the plane that wont take off. I'm on it, please release us Boston we just want to grow wings. Now we get to wave goodbye to the day
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs not an active reservation. I submitted a complaint and would like a supervisor to contact me.
@AmericanAir What's with the not taking cash at the airline check-in? That's bullshit. üò†
My old @AmericanAir reservation for the flight Dec 31, 2019 is popping up as a new booking on 2020. #computers glitch? #hack ?
@AmericanAir Still waiting. More than 36 hours since dm and no response.
Almost home. Wanted to be done with @AmericanAir forever, but they‚Äôve shackled us in by giving us vouchers versus a refund. #0customerfocus #poorcustomerexperience #theycomefirstnotyou
@AmericanAir I guess you can call #cancellation a #change.
@AmericanAir happy 2020! Any idea the slight delay on AA575 today?
@AmericanAir üëç we made it happy new years
@AmericanAir Two different NY bound flights with no crews - for hours because they all called in sick. Ridiculous. We are loyal flyers to American for over 15+ years but this has been unprofessional at this point.
@AmericanAir Don‚Äôt act like you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm talking about: of course I was aware of the fee for the change! The surprise was the cost of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù ticket... knowing you probably sold my previous seat to someone else after that. Like I wrote: #TotallyInsane.
@AmericanAir figures that American still has not given me credit for my flight on December 30th which would give me a certain status
@AmericanAir what‚Äôs the deal with my flight that is now deplaning due to maintenance issues?!?!
@AmericanAir I would like to inform you about an exceptional employee at the LAX disabled person check-in. Nicholas (AA employee) assisted my brother with compassion and kindness. I hope you are able to thank him on my behalf.
@AmericanAir should i be concerned that i'm not being allowed to check in for my return flight on the website?
@AmericanAir there‚Äôs no Lounge at Canc√∫n Airport, even though American has flights to CLT, PHL, DFW, MIA, ORD and JFK from CUN. Or am I mistaken?
@AmericanAir Nothing to do with on time. When she arrived at Dallas she was told her itinerary had been changed to a later flight. No advance warning. Claimed an e mail had been sent. We were very worried for her safety.
Five flight attendants didn't show up for @AmericanAir 774. The airline is scrambling to find replacement crew. Flight has been delayed four times so far. They've stopped making announcements (what's the point).
@AmericanAir hello, I left you an inbox message
@AmericanAir how difficult is it to change my departure from this afternoon to tomorrow morning? Flying from CVG to CLT? Do you have a number to call?
Fingers crossed I make it home. @AmericanAir flight from Chi town camceled last night hour before takeoff and already one gate change first thing this amüò¨üò¨üò¨
@AmericanAir wave goodbye to your connection
@AmericanAir today I was reminded why I don‚Äôt fly American. Crap customer service.
@AmericanAir thank you for understanding that legroom is #important
So, this was our first time flying with @AmericanAir from Mexico City to NYC and back... My mom and I loved it! Customer service, Punctuality, plane conditions and everything was so fine! Can‚Äôt wait to fly with you again, guys. Thanks for bringing us back safe!
@AmericanAir January 1st delayed over an hour for guess what a flight attendant not showing up. Surprise Surprise
@AmericanAir you canceled the flight out of Waterloo yesterday morning, which meant we didn‚Äôt make it to NYC FOR NYE. Now we‚Äôve been up since 4:00 am and our 6:08 was delayed...we were supposed to board now. Still sitting here. Bad start to 2020.
@AmericanAir Let me know who I can connect with live. We‚Äôll need reimbursement on a new flight that gets us home to our son at a reasonable hour with another airline along with an additional taxi from EWR to LGA. I‚Äôm an AA cardholder that travels exclusively with AA. Let‚Äôs get this right
@AmericanAir my vacation started out so bad ! The pilot lost / or got his wallet stolen ? What !!?! So upset right now! Flight AA2821 üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs a lot of valuable time wasted and preferably the compensation would come through either points or a free trip somewhere else. When you take a customers time and don‚Äôt compensate, you communicate that our time isn‚Äôt valuable.
@AmericanAir Thx just landed. We will try to get over there.
@AmericanAir Pilot just said they didn‚Äôt staff enough ground crew today so now we‚Äôre waiting for them. It‚Äôs like a comedy of errors in Miami!
@AmericanAir never fails to mess up our vacation. Another flight cancellation 2 hours before our flight. Horrible customer service.
@AmericanAir you have a great crew on flight 2558 from fll to dfw. Great way to start of new year. Aliza especially. Love flying American #favoriteairline
@AmericanAir I don‚Äôt appreciate being lied to by your agents at the desk in MIA for flight 1675. Customer service agent must call me ASAP. #happynewyeartoyoutoo
Another @AmericanAir fail. Hour and half before departure, they cancelled our flight and is trying to reschedule us for another that leaves 14 hours later with a layover that flies overnight and arrives the following morning.
Helluva start to 2020.@AmericanAir 1st flight on Jan 1 delayed at least 1 hr d/t mechanical. New Years Resolution #1: Mission Accomplished!
@AmericanAir your crew didn‚Äôt show up for our flight home. No weather, no maintanence. Just didn‚Äôt show up. I‚Äôm going to expect full reimbursement on this
@AmericanAir aircraft swap to a 2 class plane means I get to start 2020 with an upgrade! Sweet!
@AmericanAir Wrong answer sorry this is so unacceptable and careless we all have plans and you guys do not care if we come 2 seconds late we lose you leave hours late for no real reasons and we get screwed
I remembering whe @AmericanAir used to be a great Airline. I‚Äôve been ‚úàÔ∏è them for years &amp; am a platinum member. But in the last 6months have experienced 5 hr delays and 2 canceled flights!! AA always blames weather. If that‚Äôs true why was I able to get a flight out on #United
@AmericanAir Cancelled my flight to Chicago out of Newark this morning, no warning due to insufficient crew. This is pathetic. I expect to be compensated for the inconvenience.
First Flight of 2020 - off to a great start. JFK-SFO. #FirstClassStyle #IFlyUpFront ‚ù§Ô∏è @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir She found a 810AM flight that they were able to switch her to. Hoping the bags that were checked in Abu Dhabi arrive with the flight ü§ûüèº
@AmericanAir You‚Äôve now changed my flight time like 6 times. Get it together. This has never happened with any other airline, and it happens every time I fly American
@AmericanAir flight memphis to chicago is delayed aa3199 by 4 hours, no reasons given. Our flight yesterday was cancelled (aa3202) because of a mechanical problem 1. what are the reasons for today‚Äôs delay? 2. what are my options to fly to Chicago today? 3. Compensation?
I would like to thank @AmericanAir for a great flight this morning. It was my 6yr old son‚Äôs first flight and not only did we get a complimentary upgrade but our awesome flight attendant made sure to give him a bunch of goodies. Thank you, Tara!
@AmericanAir is theü§¥üèª of cancellations!! Cancelled a flight booked 2 months ago because ‚Äúthe crew needed to rest!üôÑSERIOUSLY!?! What, did someone call in sick. Then AA offers accommodations at crappy 2 ‚≠êÔ∏è hotel 30 min away when Hilton is right at the airport!! AA YOU SUCK!
Anyhow, @AmericanAir status is garbage, credit your BIS miles to British Airways or Iberia.
@AmericanAir it‚Äôs meant to be a happy new year.. that‚Äôs not stuck in an airport with no answer #help #memphisaiport #CustomerService
@AmericanAir why have you left my family in Memphis airport waiting to board for around 12 hours now! That is not acceptable. With no explanation.. we need answers! #help #americanairlines #AA #CustomerService
It wouldn‚Äôt be an @AmericanAir flight without a delay due to poor maintenance of its fleet, am I right? Either I have bad luck on every AA flight or they‚Äôre suffering from the 747 max fiasco and are pulling out the rusted stock.
@AmericanAir Not likely since haven‚Äôt even started boarding.
@AmericanAir we are all just standing waiting to board and now delayed because they can‚Äôt find the flight attendants I mean the plane is on the ground from last night over 200 passengers just waiting or missing connections now mia- Jfk
@AmericanAir hi! I have a flight from London to JFK tomorrow - I just made platinum but my boarding card says gold. Can you help? I‚Äôm hoping to get into the lounge tomorrow
@AmericanAir Drunk guy on AA5641 puked as we are leaving gate. Taking 50 minutes and counting to leave JAX. Have connection at 945 (will probably miss) CLT to GRR. Awful way to start 2020. App hasn‚Äôt rebooked need connecting flight...
@AmericanAir Oh then why were we taken off that plane and told to go to another new plane across the terminal? First time flying with you guys, very disappointed.
@AmericanAir Just want to give a shout out to both Lee Ann and Tammy for their excellent customer service during flight 78 DFW to LHR in business. They were a pleasure and took care of my family perfectly üòä
@AmericanAir 8am has passed. But at least it seems they got a replacement. #Delayed
Long overdue shoutout to the excellent customer service I experienced when checking in for a flight to JFK on Dec 10 at LHR with @AmericanAir - had ESTA issue and guy at desk was absolutely amazing; patient, useful, reassuring, and happy for me when it all worked out. Thanksüôè‚úàÔ∏è
No champagne in first class on New Year's Day on AA 2774! @AmericanAir, get your act together.
Ok @AmericanAir my flight to PBI was delayed a few minutes because an employee was late, now my 8am flight out of PBI is delayed 45 min because an employee called in sick? probably going to miss my connection, don‚Äôt you have a backup plan for simple incidents like this? üò´üò≠
The captain on AA2200 is hilarious and makes me so happy on an early NYD flight! @AmericanAir #HappyNewYear
@AmericanAir Good news!! We now have a full crew assigned to our flight (40 minutes after take-off) but!!! They have no clue where they are. How is this a thing that‚Äôs happening???
@AmericanAir I agree but I have never checked this bag before so why now? Just irritating at this point!!! Not to mention it was as I was walking out to the plane!
@AmericanAir can you have your crew update us on the delay status on AMSPHL? Sitting at gate for 30 mins and not one update.
@AmericanAir thank you for charging $30 for a bag that clearly fit as a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù carry on!!!!....what a nice surprise to start out my new year!!! Not to mention mine was the only bag collected saying it was to big but yet it passes your gate agents!!! üò°
‚ÄúWe apologize there is no crew right now for this flight. Looks like they decided to do a little too much partying and called in sick.‚Äù - @AmericanAir on the loudspeaker at #MIA.
@AmericanAir Our flight has now been delayed an hour because we still have no crew AT ALL and the announcer just said it‚Äôs because ‚Äúeveryone partied too much last night and is sick.‚Äù Super unprofessional!!!
@AmericanAir flight 1060 has a good shot at being cancelled because your crew members decided to party too hard last night. I have a job interview tomorrow morning that I might miss because of this. I‚Äôll never fly American again if this happens. Shameful.
@AmericanAir Hey. I‚Äôm on Aa0173 from LHR - RDU. It appears that the jet bridge has damaged the engine and this plane won‚Äôt be flying. I need to get back tonight. Are you able to tell me my options please?
@AmericanAir nothing like starting new year with missing flight crew for 630 am flight delayed two hours. Flight 2777. #handleyourbusiness
@AmericanAir Thanks for the info! Just chilling looking at two empty gates we could be boarding through.
@AmericanAir flight AA2512 out of MIA delayed for how long exactly? Evasive agent aside, how do we not have enough crew for an early morning departure? Any recourse here?
Our @AmericanAir flight is supposed to leave in 8 minutes but we haven‚Äôt event started boarding because ‚Äúthey ‚Äúcan‚Äôt find the crew and flight attendants‚Äù ????
So, as we begin our new year &amp; new decade... remember that #kindnessmatters. Shout out to @AmericanAir today! My son got a terrible headache an hour into our flight to London &amp; then a panic attack. Flight attendants were amazing &amp; took such good care of us! Thank you!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
@AmericanAir Departure time is now 13:30 and I doubt we will be in the air at that time. I'm going to miss my flight in Charlotte now. What do I do?
@AmericanAir My own fault but they came through for me. #greatful!
@AmericanAir A huge shoutout to the ticket counter staff at STL for going out of their way to get me and my bag on my flight to LAX on Sunday morning! I overslept and missed baggage time by minutes but they took care of me and got me on my way ! #execplat #loyalty
@AmericanAir What if I miss my connecting flights because of this delay?
@AmericanAir what is going on with flight 264? Explain
@AmericanAir how can I add myself to the upgrade list? help, please!
@AmericanAir am I allowed to travel with my powerbank to charge me phone
@AmericanAir Correction 12:30 now. It‚Äôs always a maintenance issue. Not like this was a turn &amp; burn flight. Seems you would run maintenance in enough time before departure to catch any issues to ensure an ON TIME departure. Maybe not wait till shortly before flight to check maint?!?
@AmericanAir my flight is delayed for so long, I need some reimbursements! Thank you very much
@AmericanAir I do want to recognize your LAX front line employees who have been dealing with a couple major delays this evening and have done so with great diligence. Shoutout to Joemar (hopefully I am spelling this right), who has been on top of things and has had impecable communucation
@AmericanAir Also there is another passenger on this flight with me would they be set too ?
@AmericanAir I check in with customer service correct ?
Update: Apparently two @AmericanAir flight attendants partied too hard last night and didn't show up. They don't have any estimated time of departure at this point.
@AmericanAir pretty bad customer service to send people to recheck bags in Miami at an unmanned counter.
Hey @AmericanAir, how is my flight delayed because of a lack of flight attendants when it's the first flight of the morning and no incoming flights were cancelled last night?
@AmericanAir What's going on with flight AA 705 from Fra to CLT? I have to get my other plane in Charlotte.
@AmericanAir 1314 is my flight number . Please give me an earlier flight soon .
@AmericanAir Thankfully EP help desk already took care of that, but the information we have been getting at the airport is that the plane was here sitting at a hangar, but no mechanics available to actually bring it to gate...
Really disappointed at the recent quality of @AmericanAir. Seems EVERY flight im on with them over the past two years has had major delays related to maint. issues, Especially with trans-Atlantic flightsZ. Seriously considering not using them for future trips.
Never flying @AmericanAir ever again . Delayed my flight three times . Not cool !!!
Happy new year! Was hoping to be in the air headed back home, but unfortunately our @AmericanAir flight is delayed and seems unclear when we‚Äôll make it out of LAX (correction, we just learned it will be at noon now instead of 11:30 PM on 12/31). Not cool!!!
@AmericanAir I have a flight tomorrow and my TSA precheck is not showing up on my boarding pass even though my KNT was present on my information profile, what can I do to get an updated boarding pass before I arrive at the airport? Help please!
@AmericanAir Lolololol. Fuck your company. Never flying with you again. I just got unboarded on this rebooked flight after being told I could go home today.
@AmericanAir Very disappointed that once again our travel plans are disrupted by an AA mechanical issue. Flight 193 to Hong Kong delayed 11 hours. Lose whole day in city. Record locator QKTMIM.
I'm a fan of security. That said, I just was asked by a baggage agent where I've been, where I ate, specifically which restaurant, how I feel, what I do for money, if a Google search will produce results in my name.....wtf? @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir because you couldn‚Äôt get 11:45 193 from LAX to HKG in the air I‚Äôm spending my NYE in LAX Voucher hotel. Thanks for nothing. Maybe some predictive analytics for your maintenance team?
@AmericanAir Thanks AA for the diversion to hell. Sitting in Embassy suites LAX south because you couldn‚Äôt get the 11:45 to Hong Kong in the air. Have a meal voucher but restaurant is closed. I‚Äôll lose a day in HK tomorrow because of this. Maybe some predictive analytics?
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs certainly made me a happy flier!
You do your part and show up hours early - before sunrise - check in online, tag your own bags, only to be rewarded with an hour long wait for the pleasure of dropping my bag. Oh, I paid 60 dollars to drop a bag, too. How is this acceptable? @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir we r 3 hrs delayed into philly and u can‚Äôt find anyone to operate a jetway to get us off the plane????
They have self serve kiosks at the airport now, so you can check in, label your own bags, and then stand in line for an amount of time that completely defeats the purpose of the kiosk. Always improving, @AmericanAir !
Going through check in hell in Japan...thanks @AmericanAir for making life with kids and a wheelchair more difficult than it needs to be.
Hey @AmericanAir my group left a jacket on your flight in San Diego. We went back to the gate and there was no one there to assist us. How can we get this back???
@AmericanAir Many thanks for your help...another instance of AA responsiveness.
I landed at 8:30 pm. I just got my bags at 10:54 pm, with no communication from @AmericanAir. Thanks, guys.
@AmericanAir The good news-12/30 return from ARN-RNO, fogged in at LHR-going to miss LHR-DFW. Called XPL desk. Very responsive Rebooked LHR-PHX-RNO same day for my wife and I on separate records! Bad news-2 of 3 Bags missing-your staff can't find in system anywhere! Help!
@AmericanAir Just admit you have no fucking clue where our bags are.
S/o to the @AmericanAir team sorry for snapping at yallüòÇüòÇ
Thanks, @AmericanAir They were able to get me sorted out!
@AmericanAir Flight landed 2 hours ago and no bags for anyone on my flight. Did you not put them on the plane before we took off? Did you leave them on the plane? Are you stealing them? Did you throw them all away?
This is a terrible night to fall apart, @AmericanAir. An hour on the tarmac and now an hour at baggage claim, and the same canned apology over and over again ‚Äî and no bags. #AA2044
@AmericanAir AA2044 at LAX. Where are our fucking bags? At this rate I should call the police and report you for theft
@AmericanAir Do you have any update other than some generic BS? Will the bags come this year?
Dana on AA8 is amazing flight attendant. Promote her! She gave me and my EP husband some champagne to celebrate NYE over the Pacific. Thanks! #AATeam @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir It‚Äôs been 45 fucking minutes and that‚Äôs after an hour of sitting on the plane waiting for a gate.
@AmericanAir On track to extending my flight by 2 hours. Where are the bags ? We were all waiting?
@AmericanAir We finally got off .... now we‚Äôve just been waiting on our bags. With no update since being told we were going to be updated. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@AmericanAir I‚Äôll do my best never to fly American again.
@AmericanAir They worked quickly. At least they didnt wait 2 hours to cancel the flight
@AmericanAir No places. Just home. But I‚Äôve been at LAX now two hours after scheduled arrival so I just surrender to this craziness.
@AmericanAir where are the bags from AA 2044 at LAX? Been waiting 40 minutes
@AmericanAir Any update? Looking for bags from Charlotte along with the passengers from that flight. Fucking idiots.
@AmericanAir batting 1.000 today. First they leave Maui 30 minutes late and take 30 extra minutes to get us to LA (which would have caused us to miss our flight) but then we get here and our connecting flight has no pilot.
@AmericanAir Waited 2 hours for our bags. Only one showed up. Nice customer service rep was able to get the other one for us. It had never been pulled despite the request.
@AmericanAir delays delays and more delays.. flight out of Bakersfield delayed by 4 hours and still stuck on Tarmac in Phoenix.. with the all food places closed now, I will be starving till 6am tomorrow when I reach in Charlotte. Ridiculous start to the new year!
@AmericanAir We‚Äôre planning a family adventure this year. üëçüèª
@AmericanAir Everyone from my flight is here and waiting.
@AmericanAir Baggage claim from JED contacted asked to pick from JED, but we are in Madinah, tomorrow going to Dammam, and returning to DFW on 10th. No way I can pick from JED, and why I should goto JED and pick it ?
@AmericanAir Yes, but because the next flight was 12 hours later, she would miss her flight from the destination onwards. Instead of AA claims paying for the (non AA) missed flight via claims process (as rec. by rep), would be cheaper for you to have just booked her on an AA flight to replace
Executive Platinum for the past 5 years with @AmericanAir but not this year. 2020 resolution : stay home, be productive, love my family.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the automated response. Thats what you said 12 hours ago. Thanks for the extra miles #not
@AmericanAir The way to apologize is excellent customer service. Instead of booking an available flight to replace the one that was going to be missed she was told to go through the claims process later and that nothing can be done at this point through american airlines booth.
@AmericanAir Why spearheaded kids from their parents? It says right on it that it‚Äôs a child‚Äôs boarding pass and the only answer is ‚Äúpay more money to move your seat‚Äù
@AmericanAir Waiting for an hour. Incompetent assholes.
@AmericanAir Thanks for extending my flight by an hour (and still counting).
@AmericanAir You say this every time but I‚Äôm beginning not to believe you.
@AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. Knowing they had customers coming in late and letting every employee go home. Thanks I don‚Äôt mind waiting at an airport.
S/o to @AmericanAir for making me miss my flight home can never do anything right
@AmericanAir why does it always take so long for a gate to open up at LAX? Every time.
@AmericanAir Still sitting out here just wasting my life away.
New year's desire: a gift of extra space for my legs in the @AmericanAir flight!
@AmericanAir Having trouble redeeming miles because you guys don‚Äôt recognize UAE credit cards. Pl advise.
@AmericanAir where‚Äôs my stroller? Y‚Äôall lost it/told me you had no one to go look for it. This was in the end of November. I filed a claim on it to be found, received an email and text saying y‚Äôall were searching and haven‚Äôt heard anything since ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è brand new stroller, $ wasted!!
@AmericanAir Its atrocious. I'll be in touch with your press team when I land to complain. It's New Years Eve and I expected something special and what I got was a can of Heineken. Zero customer service.
@AmericanAir I did please check once
My friend traveled from Cincinnati to Amsterdam flying Delta faster than I traveled from Cincinnati to Buffalo, NY thanks to the slew of delays and late crew members you fucked me with @AmericanAir Also, I spent my NYE on an airplane thanks to you guys. Happy New Year!
@AmericanAir I sent you a DM with details. Please assist. I will be very obliged.
Thrown up 8 times since 830pm.. supposed to fly at 920 tomorrow morning.. the @AmericanAir rep def thought it was alcohol related. Don‚Äôt know what to do üò©üò©üò© and of course it‚Äôs the most expensive flight I‚Äôve ever booked.. üò≠üò≠
@AmericanAir so 10 minutes before my overnight flight boards we're told there are no charging ports or entertainment on the flight bc they decided to use an old aircraft. ü§Æ Can I get a partial refund for this BS???
@AmericanAir officially the worst airline ever! Will never fly again...
Thx @AmericanAir for blowing NYE for us. Ugh. Stuck in Dallas waiting on a shuttle to a cheap hotel. Ugh.
@AmericanAir Pls look into the time from point A (plane) to B on (baggage claim) domestic flights into CLT - it‚Äôs been awful for the last 3+ years which is sooo odd since CLT is a hub!
imagine taking an @AmericanAir flight and when you land your checked bag (with fragile Christmas items) is completely broken....like wut
I will be on a red-eye flight when the ball drops (pacific time). Looking forward to toasting with @AmericanAir‚Äôs finest champagne.
@AmericanAir We're about to board now. I wonder if we have a pilot this time..............
Thank you @AmericanAir for getting me home safe. ‚úàÔ∏èüá∫üá∏
@AmericanAir I did please check once
