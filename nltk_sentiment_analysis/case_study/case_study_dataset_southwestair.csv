Lotta Ravens fans punching in that BWI-FLL route for the first weekend in February on @SouthwestAir tonight
@SouthwestAir what’s so hard about switching out a tug that’s broken down? Tow and go! This is ridiculous!
Today on my @SouthwestAir flight from PDX to DIA, once we landed the flight attendant got on and said “Please keep those who serve in any branch of our armed forces in your prayers, adopt, don’t shop, and spay and neuter your pets,we thank you for flying with us.” I love her.
@SouthwestAir - yesterday sea pulled off minor miracle. Daughter flying SAN-SEA thru Sacramento. Origin flight late leaving going to miss last SEA of day. 12 min connect time, you held plane 4 her, she and her checked bags made it to SEA. Thank you #firstclassisnotaticket #luv
@SouthwestAir So do your job interviews start with "Tell me something clever, original, and funny."? Or are all you guys like this by coincidence?
@SouthwestAir unfortunately I didn’t fly to San Jose today but my golf clubs did. 1 of 2 bags arrived when they were checked at the same time.
@SouthwestAir has the funniest flight attendants but these planes smell like 💩
I’m literally crying I left my brand new iPad on the plane😢😢😢 @SouthwestAir how do I get it back 😢😢😢😢😢
@SouthwestAir why are we still waiting for a gate 30 minutes after landing on flight 3445?
@SouthwestAir Just glad to be home 💕 still love ya guys
@SouthwestAir really sucked this time. Normally I have such a pleasant experience. Smfh.
Alright @SouthwestAir, 3 hours late... still have a 5 hour flight 😫🥱 Just want to crawl into my bed already.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for replying. Not sure my question was answered...-?-
@SouthwestAir What happened to your OAK to SJD non stop flights? Thought it was 1 per day?
Fun tip- If any of you took my advice and picked up the Southwest card for the companion pass in 2019, check your app. Odds are you got A-list status free for 2020 as an Xmas gift. Thx @SouthwestAir
1 Just witnessed the MOST entitled family on @SouthwestAir . The parents and grandparents upgraded to Alist to board in the first group and just assumed their kids/grandkids/nieces would be allowed on also. The woman at the gate corrected them
Flying during the holidays has to be the worst flights I’ve ever experienced @SouthwestAir
Was on a plane during the 4th quarter. Shout out to @SouthwestAir for the free live TV, couldn’t imagine having missed that.
Incredible props to @SouthwestAir and their INCREDIBLE team in helping our 84 year old Grama D make it home SAFE and EASY from PHX-SEA. First class service from curb to curb that made her feel so special! This is why I’m an A-List Preferred Member and always will be! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@SouthwestAir did u see my tweet?
Aye my pilot is a woman. Thank you @SouthwestAir for that letting us know! Awesome to see that. 🥰
keep your fingers crossed — @SouthwestAir may have one direct flight from RIC to MCO (and the return trip) during the summer…could save us some 💰!
@SouthwestAir what would A small content creator gotta do for a free trip? I have a wedding to attend in July! :D
@SouthwestAir I will for sure! Thank you!!
@SouthwestAir 25 min waiting for bags at SJC is a bit long!
@SouthwestAir my Rapid Rewards won’t update after my completed round trip
@SouthwestAir what an absolutely brutal day of travel on southwest. Nothing but delayed and basically canceled flights with poor communication. What airline isn't completely terrible, are there any? #Travel just sitting here on the plane because there isn't room for all bags, wtf
@SouthwestAir still have no clue how you guys don’t have power ports at every seat.
Thanks a lot @SouthwestAir you did it again!!!
@SouthwestAir huge shout out to you and your customer service lady in regards to my return flight from Phoenix to Seattle. I love flying with you and you guys rock. You made my 28th birthday more affordable. And that's transfarency
@SouthwestAir what’s up with flight 4720 BWI-DAL?? Y’all are never late!
@SouthwestAir 2/2 Chaos, mental anguish, and a crew member telling me, with a snarky attitude, ‘well other passengers don’t usually do it that way’ when I complained. Wtf?! No more. I will fly ANYONE else.
@SouthwestAir 1/2 I’ve never been auto-rebooked on a flight till today. Total disaster, after being rebooked TWICE w/out my input, the 2nd time after having changed my flight myself.
Whoever is on my @SouthwestAir chicago to Vegas..definitely is thinking twice about having kids.
@SouthwestAir when do you normally give the $75 yearly travel credit?
Another day another delayed @SouthwestAir flight #disappointed
Hey @SouthwestAir it'd really be pretty cash money of you to be able to search from multiple airports in a region... having to do separate searches for LAX, BUR, SNA, ONT, and LGB is silly and should be an easy problem to fix.
Listening to people on this @SouthwestAir plane cheer in waves for the #texans because their streams are all different.
@SouthwestAir my cousin can’t go to Cuba due to her pregnancy, am I able to change the name to my niece. My flight is in February!!!!!!!! HELP ME!!!!
@SouthwestAir I was just harassed by your gate agent.
@SouthwestAir No I didn’t l— I wasn’t aware I could do that.
NEVER flying @SouthwestAir ever again. always a pain. have to pay for wifi. and best of all, had to run across all of BWI because my flight that was supposed to stay on the same plane suddenly changed! so now i had to run all around. fucking hate it.
@SouthwestAir It’s important to share this so others can know to avoid your airline!!! Sorry, but no need to wait until my travel is complete for me to discuss this awful service so others can be aware of how awful southwest is
My day with @SouthwestAir: They graciously changed my flight so I could be home sooner while feeling sick, flight arrived nearly 30m early, + I just went in to confirm next week's trip and I was able to rebook it and save 1,100 RR points, immediately available on my acct. 💙❤️💛
@SouthwestAir Also, bc this started in Houston hours ago, a heads up could have been given to people but for hours you told us it’s a 15 min delay. You guys mess up and don’t have the courtesy to fix things. Glad you guys have money but not everyone get can a month of medication again.
My husband has been on the phone with @SouthwestAir for FOUR HOURS and they still can't (won't?) fix his problem. Boo! 👎🚨🍅 😱
@SouthwestAir Also, don’t you think there is an issue with your gate agent can’t tell me why a plane is being delayed? Especially for such a large delay? It’s insane to think you guys didn’t have a backup plan or do anything considering the initial issue started hours ago in Houston.
@SouthwestAir And so what are you guys gonna do about this domino effect? I’m traveling with expensive medication that needs refrigeration and the ice packs that I brought aren’t going to cover the now two hour delay. These happens all the time with southwest and yet they seem to not care.
Tonight you really failed @SouthwestAir. My husband and daughter have been waiting for 40 minutes for a car seat that was just delivered soaking wet. They were on flight 6367 from Portland to BWI. You guys are too good for stupid mistakes like this. Disappointed.
Honestly @SouthwestAir flexibility with changes &amp; cancellations is unmatched. I’ll always fly y’all❤️💙💛
Maybe we don’t have this figured out @SouthwestAir Now you’re expected at 7:15 but it’s 7:20. Guess I won’t be making trips back to the Middle Ages any time soon. However I am excited to get back to Atlanta. So even with a slight delay, I’m glad you can get me there in one piece
@SouthwestAir I have a question about a travel voucher I have that expires on the 8th can you help
I hope you go bankrupt @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir curious how I was told my Companion Pass would be valid the remainder of the year gained (2019) and the following year (2020), but it’s 2020 now and no Companion Pass.. Just me or is this happening to others too?
@SouthwestAir Just surprising there’s not even one direct option per day, and the layovers are long and you have to change planes. Makes it really difficult to fly such a short distance. Thanks for the respoonse.
Disappointed @SouthwestAir my mom moved to Jacksonville, FL area and there are zero direct flights from DCA or IAD to JAX. Travel that should take 2 hours would take 6+. Going to have to fly a different airline. Sad.
third airport today. thanks @SouthwestAir 😎
@SouthwestAir I’m flying to FL via Southwest in 10 days! I can’t wait!! I literally only fly Southwest!
@SouthwestAir HELP we just got a text saying our flight to Nassau on 1/5 is cancelled and can’t rebook until Monday! Have to get there tomorrow!
@SouthwestAir Last comment! You should go the extra mile especially right now!!!! They are fighting for you!
@SouthwestAir Can I get any help with this? I still can't access my info. My flight is in a few days and I don't want this to interfere with my check in
@SouthwestAir And I had to stop as we were departing to let them go ahead of me!!! They should be the first to exit with applause!
@SouthwestAir I’m sorry. They should go before A!!
Overheard on this @SouthwestAir flight to Hobby: “There’s children everywhere.” Uh yeah. You’re welcome. #travelingwithkids
@SouthwestAir And that is why I normally fly Delta
@SouthwestAir And there’s nothing else you can do, as in reimburse me for some of my flight or help make any other accommodations for this inconvenience
@SouthwestAir It’s very inconvenient. We had a meeting to be at and now we are going to be extremely late
@SouthwestAir can y’all give eric at BWI a raise? he gave me genuinely the best experience i’ve ever had with an airline. i love y’all 🥰
@SouthwestAir Flight #6570 and now flight #5866
This is exactly why I fly @SouthwestAir because they get you to where you have to be even in a blizzard!
@SouthwestAir why is my flight being delayed like every 5 min. I love you don’t do this to me.
@SouthwestAir seriously needs do something about the baggage claim process... I always have to wait 30-40 min for my bags to come! What is this!? #SouthwestAirlines #baggage #baggageclaim #problems
@SouthwestAir Ok thanks how do I get my credits from last year?
Hey @SouthwestAir why are we sitting on the tarmac? 578 in PHX. No word from the crew. Been 30 minutes. Still at gate. Captain in and out of cockpit. The natives are getting restless.
I am never flying @SouthwestAir again. The cattle call boarding process, the lengthy time spent on the tarmac, trying to charge for a lap infant. Absolute worst airline experience I've ever had. I'm just praying this plane makes it to LaGuardia in one piece.
@SouthwestAir stop delaying my flight every time I fly please🙄🥱🥴
@SouthwestAir what steps do I need to take to add my cat to my itinerary to fly with me?
Just wanna give an appreciation tweet to @SouthwestAir 1. For the Recognition of troops being deployed Dallas Love. 2. Cause they are so sweet and generous . 3 for flying our hockey team helping with all of our equipment and such. Love ❤️
@SouthwestAir delayed our flight from LGA to MDW from 6:50 to 8:10 with no explanation! The agent at the gate says there is no explanation for this too. The weather in both Chi and NYC is totally fine and yet this is a routine practice for you guys. No transparency or respect!
@SouthwestAir Looks like I’ve been re-booked. Hopefully the others in my party have as well. Thanks. I appreciate it.
My flights have been delayed 6 times on @SouthwestAir and there’s not even weather issues
@SouthwestAir We are landing after our connection takes off. Let’s re-book the connection now. There’s nothing to wait on. Thanks.
Had to change my @SouthwestAir flight, and the only way to avoid having to stay in an airport overnight was to fly into another LA airport three times further from my place AND drop down almost two full boarding classes... Great start to 2020, y’all. (I’m already so tired.)
@SouthwestAir when do you open up the rest of the schedule for flying?
Gave the @SouthwestAir attendant some snickers and someone came over to apologize to me because I wouldn’t be getting snacks based on the weather. Lol. I just wanted y’all to have some snickers haha
@SouthwestAir would love for you to have the drink coupons available via the Southwest App since it’s already linked to our account.
.@SouthwestAir when myself and another passenger asked the SW rep at the gate if our flight has left since it said departed she responded “are you two going to answer your own questions”. As if we had no reason to be concerned
Took 2 @SouthwestAir flights this week with a 2+ hour delay. At least the first one from LGA we got a travel voucher. Now the Southwest app and site says my flight took off 3 minutes ago, and the attendant is completely unhelpful
My biggest accomplishment of the day was having one suitcase be 48 pounds and another be 33 pounds. (Thank you @SouthwestAir!!)
@SouthwestAir hi! Was disappointed to hear you’re discontinuing direct service between LGA and MKE. You’re my favorite airline and I fly Southwest on that route multiple times a year. Whyyyyyyy?
Hey @SouthwestAir, we’re on 316 to Houston. But… the flight was over an hour lake and somehow, in g flight, this 2.5 hour flight is now nearly 4 hours. So we’re going to miss our 5:05 departure on 2720 from HOU. Is there some way to re-book in flight? DM me, bro.
@SouthwestAir You clearly didn’t see part 2 to my tweet. I hope my travel goes smoothly as well, seeing how my flight has been delayed twice now.
Why tf would you bring me out that bland piece of luggage like I’m going to be happy with that solution?? If i wanted plain luggage i would have BOUGHT plain luggage🗣🗣🗣 @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir I’m flying into Orlando at 7:35 and my connecting flight out to Harford, CT leaves at 7:30. If me and my dad don’t make this flight we will be stuck in Orlando all night. Can you hold the flight a little bit so we can get home, thank you so much!
@SouthwestAir how are the wife and I A03 and A04 and there is literarily 40-50 folks pre boarding. Wheelchairs and small kids, fine, grown ass capable adults.....?
@SouthwestAir claiming their throne as the most frustrating airline
@SouthwestAir hi there! I created an account to make points and accidentally used my maiden name when creating the account. Can I change that?
Horrific service from @SouthwestAir at MCI. I’m standing there with my hands full, two huge bags to check, people in line waiting behind me, so I hand the tags to the lady so she can assist putting them on. She hands it back and says “I can explain how”... Lady I can read.
I’m so fed up with @SouthwestAir at PHX (gate c1) bc we havent moved in 25 min
@SouthwestAir Well, if you’re sorry than fix it and get us on the plane!
@SouthwestAir Being an Aviation Enthusiast, I absolutely ❤ getting some warm wishes from Airlines. Will I be able get some wishes today too? For 5th year in a row? ;)
Waiting for my @SouthwestAir flight home from #Oakland to #Chicago with a quick stop in #SanDiego: enjoyed this week in #SanFrancisco!
@SouthwestAir I completely understand and my family had only five bags with one of those bags being the size of the purse.
@SouthwestAir Alec just lied to me about being held for weather. It’s beautiful in Phoenix today
@SouthwestAir No worries! We aren't even at the airport yet. Just prepping before leaving. Wasn't sure if they would cancel this far out. Thanks for the quick response
@SouthwestAir People that came from SEA are just slow. You suck on
@SouthwestAir flight 4771 Phx to BWI should be boarding. Why isn’t it?
@SouthwestAir Sorry for the abuse! Just had to vent. A cerveza in Terminal D is making things smoother.
@SouthwestAir our flight from TPA to PVD has been pushed back over 3 hours. Wondering what the odds are of complete cancellation and what type of notice is usually given
@SouthwestAir We bought 3 tickets for my family to fly from SNA to SJC and the agent who scanned their boarding passes stopped us because we had “too many bags.” We had 5 bags total and one of those bags was a small bag for our kids milk and bottle. The flight isn’t even full
@SouthwestAir Flight 4199 was delayed due to a dent in the left wing. And now we have to go to new gate and new plane to go to Kansas city. In Kansas we have to get to a conection and it looks like we’re gonna miss it. Do we get any compensation for this? Coupon? Money back?? ❤️
I got up at 5 am so I wouldn’t be getting home at 11pm but @SouthwestAir sure makes it possible!
@SouthwestAir Good afternoon-I wanted to let you know that I am stuck on Flight 2945 HOU-MCO. Circumstances have been outside your control today, but giving the crew the ability to comp free WiFi would be an excellent way to gesture of goodwill. Currently they can only do drinks.
Why do I ever fly @SouthwestAir when I have to make a connection? Even a two hour layover isn't enough to make a connection with all the fucking inevitable delays and they're more than willing to put me on the latest possible flight.
@SouthwestAir Sent! Thanks for your fast response.
@SouthwestAir My flight was spectacular except we didn’t receive drink service either way.
@SouthwestAir i am currently sitting on some runway in Florida waiting for my flight to take off after it being delayed 4 hours. I arrived at this air port at 6, it has been more than 8 hours that I have been waiting to go home. For wasting my time would you give me tix to italy
@SouthwestAir Just sent it. Thanks! But she just called us and she was moved and at the plane now.
Why are @SouthwestAir flights SO expensive???
@SouthwestAir Was told there is no in flight menu to purchase food . Yes saw the alcohol I suppose that’s will have to fill us up .
Hey @SouthwestAir ... should consider offering food for purchase if you don’t let ppl get off the plane to get some during layovers ... 🤬🤬 like wtf .
@SouthwestAir My bad. I’ll send the DM momentarily. Thanks, Alec!
@SouthwestAir Since I dm’d you, we are yet stuck again in the runway. I also asked if I could use my expired 4 days ago drink coupons, since you all kept us waiting for going on 3.5 hours, and was told no. #youguysaretheworst
I fucking logged in my tsa pre check number online and when I get here they tell me I have to fucking wait in line to fix a mistake they did? I got pre check to avoid lines in the first place. Fuck you @SouthwestAir
Heading to San Francisco for Professional Convention Management Association...@SouthwestAir get me to Chicago on time from Albany to make connection. Thank you!
@SouthwestAir It’s all good. If you read the tweets, you’ll see that I’m thankful, not complaining.
@SouthwestAir Hundreds of us waiting for our flight to Providence after a delay of almost 4 hours. We’ll be departing 45 minutes after we should have arrived. #disappointed #Southwest
@SouthwestAir why does your app update a flight arrival being late 5 minutes at a time? Flight 4876 from Chicago to Ft Myers left 4 minutes late. Arriving at 1:20. And now as I wait for them it’s gone from 1:20 to 1:25 to 1:30 to 1:35 to 1:40 to 1:45 to 1:50 to 1:55 landed at 2.
@SouthwestAir Some RR points and we'll call it even 😉?
@SouthwestAir Flight 43 dal to hou
Hey @SouthwestAir, I’d like to let you know about an employee of yours, who helped prevent a potentially scary situation.
my ticket back home is $58 thank to my travel voucher &amp; my way back to Phoenix was free from points 🥳 I love @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Thank you !!! They got in contact with me . I just had to go upstairs and downstairs twice to ask them about my lock on luggage .
@SouthwestAir I used to brag about how great of an airline you “WERE” until today. 😡 HOW IN THE HELL DO YOU LOSE MY LUGGAGE IN A WHOLE DIFFERENT STATE!!!! I will be discontinuing my flying services with your airline.
@SouthwestAir how do file a claim for my broken suitcase?
Sitting on the tarmac for almost 3 hours, @SouthwestAir chooses the moment we get cleared for takeoff to ask for volunteers to take a later flight. We’re still sitting here. #letsgo #southwest #stopoverbookingflights
@SouthwestAir so disappointed. My 12 yr old flew by himself this morning which is fine however your system would not allow me to check him in 24 hours early because he’s a minor. At the airport they say he does not get to board early so he’s the last one on!
@SouthwestAir Love u so much was accepted for SWA Priority CC 5 days ago (don’t have card yet). Today on a SWA flight, saw “in flight” offer bonus (50k points v. 40k). Kind of bummed I missed out on 10k? Any chance getting that 10k? For a fan! Luv!
@SouthwestAir hi, I have a question regarding an existing reservation. Can I send a DM?
Say what you will about @SouthwestAir, but I love them for short-haul flights. A little humor and a smile go a long way ✈️
@SouthwestAir 10 flights with y'all last year, and a new priority cc opened, but I didn't get the promotional a list status y'all were giving out 😭😭. Why u gotta break my SW heart 💔😢
@SouthwestAir The usual clown show trying to fly SW. All the efficiency of a 3rd world airline. Congratulations.
@SouthwestAir I’ll be calling Monday for a refund. I have been flying for 40 years! I’ve had a companion pass for 6 years! I know when I have been cheated.
@SouthwestAir The kiosk wasn’t inoperable, I wasn’t interested in using it. Seemed lazy to me and I’m the one paying for a service. But overall it speaks to how airline travel is these days, high prices, less service, more frustration. Even so, I’m still a SW fan.
@SouthwestAir I’m calling customer service Monday. The gate employee could have upgraded us the A list. I’m done sequins with you behind your computer.
@SouthwestAir Christi a flight attendant on my flight from SMF-PDX Flight#6241 9am is amazing! Her positive attitude is wonderful. She has a free hugs button on and made me smile. The world needs more hugs. As always I love Southwest airlines.
@SouthwestAir you’re welcome southwest i love you
@SouthwestAir It’s just a marketing tool to generate more $$
@SouthwestAir The early bird didn’t do squat
Pumped to be flying cross country with @SouthwestAir this time around!! ✈️✈️✈️
@SouthwestAir I checked us in at 12:55 today. We didn’t have a board number until then so you’re wrong!
@SouthwestAir something needs to be done with all these "support/emotional dogs" on flights. Ticket agent told us we were the only people actually paying to take out dogs on flight today. Should we be lying and get a note from vet to not pay? #dogsonflights
@SouthwestAir Why you don’t tie these reservations together so our boarding passes and together is stupid. It makes using the companion pass a pain in the butt. Put some common sense into your loyalty program.
@SouthwestAir That’s not good enough ni want a refund for the early bird fees.
@SouthwestAir Thank you! About to take off now! 😁✈
@SouthwestAir I spend $300k a year on my SWA Visa. Should receive better treatment for my loyalty
@SouthwestAir Well they should be and always were until recently. I paid for early bird and now we have to both go in B group. That’s a total rip off of my early bird payment. Companions should Always have the next in line bidding pass. It’s common sense. Apparently something your comp needs!
@SouthwestAir Hehehehe AUS to LAS 😁
@SouthwestAir What was worse, the SWA person at baggage claim post was rude.
@SouthwestAir Actually, that wasn’t an option. I was handed the tags to do myself. So there’s that.
@SouthwestAir I appreciate the apology for confusion. I'm more angry than confused. Reddit post states it is common when flying SW. My hubby and BIL fly right along side of me every time and it has never happened to them. It has now happened to me twice in one month. Feels like bias.
@SouthwestAir Flight was on time, but the 45 minute delay to get our bags was ridiculous. Especially when you have a friend waiting outside to pick you up.
@SouthwestAir is there a known issue with the app or website? Have been trying to sign in all morning and keeps saying to try later too many imcorrects attemps. I did try but know i have correct credentials and enough time has gone by that even that should b no issue
@SouthwestAir do you ever "add flights"? Very strangely- every single flight on a date that is over 2 weeks away and on a very non-popular route is completely sold out.
@SouthwestAir you need to improve companion passes so they always have the next pass. My young daughter is in B boarding! We even purchased early bird too! Unacceptable customer experience for us. The gate person was rude and unapologetic too. Get it together.
@SouthwestAir Thank you so much!!!! 💙❤️💛!!! Let’s not tell my husband about this faux pas 😚
Can y’all not go through the south side next time? It was a lot of potholes on the way to ATL. @SouthwestAir
Hey @SouthwestAir when are you going to have planes with outlets at the seats?
@SouthwestAir to make matters worse the customer service rep (who was totally friendly) could only refund or change my flight. Neither of these options are realistic. He provided me a number for corporate. They are not even open today...
@SouthwestAir Throw this in the suggestion box - ATC recognizes a cold front in the hours its on the radar beforehand, keep 4 or 5 planes in go status, and let the other 15 planes hang out in the empty gates where it's not an open cement field.
@SouthwestAir is it your standard to change flight itineraries without providing any notification? Instead of an email saying “we changed your flights,” I received my final flight confirmation with a different time that I purchased. This not acceptable. 1/2
hey @SouthwestAir, why is it that selecting both ski and boot bags only ever prints one luggage tag? I know they *count* as one, but I still need to tag both. happens every time.
Woke up to an email from @SouthwestAir sending $$$ towards a new flight from yesterday’s shenanigans, there is a god 😭❤️
@SouthwestAir whyyyy are tickets so expensive from CA to TX in March?! What happened to all the amazing sales?! We’re not rich, but we need to get there so I can be the maid of honor for my sisters wedding!
@SouthwestAir just turned away someone in the service from priority boarding for not being in uniform. C’mon.
@SouthwestAir I was on the the 7amish flight from Boston to Fort Lauderdale. I’m exhausted. I booked my flight yesterday to be in FL for my friend, who I’ve known for 35 years, who’s father passed away unexpectedly. My flight attendant was Karen. Karen was WONDERFUL.
@SouthwestAir thank goodness for Connie at the Tampa counter. We had a family emergency and she was able to get us on an earlier flight. #goodpeopleexist #southwest #ThankYou
Note to self: @SouthwestAir is a disaster for flying with lap children. About to miss our flight after waiting AN HOUR to check in their "full service" line.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the response. I’m just trying to help a friend out.
Flying United for the first time in years and thus far my day has been filled with reminders of I've gone years without flying United. @SouthwestAir I'm sorry I love you I made a mistake please take me back I want to come home.
@SouthwestAir Hello! Nope I still need assistance. I’ve booked my mother’s flights so frequently I didn’t give it a thought when I filled in the wrong last name for myself.
@SouthwestAir Thank you. Not frustrated, just trying to understand. It's slightly more clear, but I'm still struggling a bit... Military (out of uniform) boarding early were impacting the integrity of the boarding process? What does this mean exactly?
@SouthwestAir how do we retrieve a lost stuff animal from a plane we departed this morning ?
@SouthwestAir Tiny tots are demanding snacks we are still on the ground. "I actually wanted chips"
This @SouthwestAir FA has infinite patience with two rows of unaccompanied, including one tiny jack-in-a-box who popped in and out of the bathroom six times in 3sec until the FA successfully wrangled him in.
8 business trips flying @SouthwestAir over the next 4 weeks. Getting a good start on that A-List Preferred status this year. Let’s go.
@SouthwestAir you’re about to lose a loyal a list member for good. Quit canceling early LAX&gt;SFO FLIGHTS. Also, why doesn’t a list priority support work? #ultimatefail #byeee
@SouthwestAir A friend of mine is trying to search our site for travel to a funeral, but all he is getting is a message “Site Not Available.” Might let tech ops have a look at that. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir just dropped my son off at MKE and no announcement or acknowledgement to board Military personal before others on his flight! Not happy about that Southwest, I usually brag about your airlines and how great you treat the military. Step it up please❤️🇺🇸
Been standing around waiting 25 minutes for our luggage 😅 @SouthwestAir Y’all sniffing everyone’s panties one by one or what?!
@SouthwestAir The music for that 2048 Pair game was total AMSR
@SouthwestAir gate E33 flt to DEN from STL after flt last night cncld after our arrival at FLL after a crazy long drive. Promised priority boarding on our final leg and gate agents here cld not have been more rude. Disgusted by her attitude and treatment of us.
@SouthwestAir You do control whether it gets on the same plane as I do.
@SouthwestAir the fact I wasn’t even asked for my military ID to see my active duty status was ridiculous. However a kid walked up to me to shake my hand &amp; said thank you for your service. I was going to let it go but over the speaker another plane boarded military out of uniform
@SouthwestAir No, I didn’t realize it was broken until I left the airport. Is this something I can do now?
@SouthwestAir can y’all be consistent about boarding military personnel? I was completely embarrassed in front of the whole boarding group when my flight was boarding &amp; the attendant looked at me. She didn’t even open her mouth for military then she says we only board in uniform.
@SouthwestAir I am so upset by your policy. I am stuck here as I paid my very last money to book the flight. I even asked for just another flight. Was told no. Mind you, this was a refundable flight. I can't believe this.
@SouthwestAir At no point was I verbally abusive nor was I impatient. I even suggested options. I have never cried so hard as we have just buried my little boys father. And now we need to get home. So I don't lose my job.
@SouthwestAir Beyond the fact that I was misinformed. It was the lack of ownership, accountability and empathy. To top it off I was denied ability to speak to management and the rep. Advised me her lead advised her to disconnect the call.
@SouthwestAir Due to me not being able to get a flight from St. Croix to San Juan I had to cancel. That is where the problems began.
@SouthwestAir I WAS excited at the opportunity to fly with you. I seldom have the opportunity because of where I fly from to my destinations. I booked a flight from San Juan to DTW.
@SouthwestAir Well of course that was explained to us. I understand. But do we wait all day to switch planes so those traveling can get where they need to be? They pulled us off then put us back on the same plane.
While it can be a pain with companions, traveling alone on @SouthwestAir is the best. Second row window seat; what other airline would let you have that without paying through the nose?
The worst thing too is that I have two checked bags, so I can’t just cancel it all and ask for a refund to fly elsewhere, but all other @SouthwestAir flights are full for today apart from this one late ass flight 🥺 I got up at 3:30am for nothing 🥵
@SouthwestAir ATL to BWI flight #6548
@SouthwestAir we had a 4 hour delay on flight 2381 out of OAK causing me to miss meetings + my bag was damaged on the flight. could I DM one of your reps ASAP to resolve this issue?
@SouthwestAir That’s not going to change the fact I will be VERY late. Never had a bad experience with you all, but this is unbelievable.
Now we are staying on this one? Just make a decision so we can all get where we’re going! @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir takes an hour to decide we have to switch planes? We pick our flight times because we have places to be at certain times. I can understand slight delays, but this baffles me.
@SouthwestAir why do people talk on Speaker Phone while on plane? So annoying...#ineedcoffee #rude
We meet again @SouthwestAir It’s been too long. Looking forward to two stress-free, friendly flights!
@SouthwestAir A DM with both my confirmation number and incident number has been sent.
@SouthwestAir Crap happens and I don’t fault anyone who deals with us on twitter but blaming the unaccountable, unreachable, anonymous courier you gave the bag to doesn’t help those of us going in to hour 15+ of a wait.
@SouthwestAir “You’ll have it in 4-6 hours” - I didn’t. “It’ll arrive by 11pm” - it hasn’t. “The courier will call” - they didn’t. 15hrs now. Will the courier get here before I have to check out if my hotel? Who knows! Their website doesn’t update and there’s no wait to contact em. 🙃
@SouthwestAir I can understand that. But it certainly doesn’t help each and frustrations when the couriers provide no info and when all the info Southwest gives wrong (“it’ll be put on the next flight” - it wasn’t. “It’ll grr picked up at 2pm” 1 it wasn’t.
@SouthwestAir my stupid/sleepy ass just booked a ticket for a flight for Monday and accidentally put my wife's maiden name in her info. Is it possible to fix this?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for hearing me out. Is it possible to bring this up in Dallas for a review of said policies?
@SouthwestAir I understand that, but to neither condone or prohibit seat saving actively goes against your own “open seating policy”. As aforementioned, if I’m allowed to pick any available seat, THAT is what I’d expect. Especially if a pax is lying and they just want a row to themselves.
@SouthwestAir Let’s talk about the people who save seats for other passengers who haven’t even boarded yet, and the FA’s allow it. If Southwest’s policy is “pick any available seat” then that’s exactly what that means, and saving seats shouldn’t be allowed. It’s not a school bus.
@SouthwestAir Can I use them in February if they expired 12/2019? Please say yes.
@SouthwestAir I’m still waiting for my luggage, 14 hours later. You say “Bags fly free” but apparently mine dont get put on planes at all? In this time I could have driven up to SFO to get my suitcase and driven back to LAX in less time it takes you to get a delayed bag to me 😜
@SouthwestAir when will we be able to book through august 2020? 😊💛
Airheads @SouthwestAir The agent said they can’t give out a voucher for the lost items 🙄 My son has no medicine, diapers, formula, or change of clothes to get him through the night.
@SouthwestAir The problem ultimately is that people know they can exploit Southwest for better seats which they can’t with other airlines. I have seen multiple times in the last year wheelchair boarders sprint off the plane for connecting flights.
I bought a last min flight with Frontier, and I usually go with @SouthwestAir. Southwest is better, and they make me feel safe when I fly with them. This time it was cheaper to go with Froniter. I feel like I'm betraying SW. I still love ya Southwest. Why you so expensive tho?
@SouthwestAir lost my son’s bag that had all his formula, diapers, wipes, and clothes in it 😡
@SouthwestAir also truly sorry could at least be a drink ticket or free wifi, yeah? 😐
@SouthwestAir my dear, as some who missed a connection by ten minutes without a flight being held, and subsequently got stuck in a rando city overnight, you get no forgiveness from me on this one. enjoy your friday.
@SouthwestAir You have the best customer service on twitter
@SouthwestAir I got my luggage back with one less wheel than it started with on my trip. Can you help? #taleofthethreewheeledsuitcase
@SouthwestAir I was a "no show" per emergency hospitalization. Attempting to get an account credit; SW Customer Care suggested I could have asked a nurse to help me cancel my trip. Another scolded me because I had up to 10 min before takeoff to cancel and could have.
@SouthwestAir did me dirty today. Twice.
@SouthwestAir thanks responding i appreciate it
@SouthwestAir how long does it to put my money put back on my card 🥴🤔🤔once I cancel flight
Thanks to the pilots on flight 795 from Ft Myers to a Indy. Rough conditions and great safe flight. Love @SouthwestAir Thank you!
Back in Boston and likely passing on @SouthwestAir in the future. My suitcase is broken (but in a way I couldn’t tell until I was out of the airport) and our clothes are wet. So much for all that laundry we did before leaving NC.
@SouthwestAir Thank you so much Tayler ❤️
Dang they’re even so nice on the internet Still sad but @SouthwestAir is really cool
Just throwing in my 2 cents. I’ve seen a lot of posts of people talking badly about @SouthwestAir but I just don’t see it, and I don’t get it either. Southwest got me extremely upset a few weeks ago, but they still made it right and made me happy. #MyOnlyAirline
@SouthwestAir our plane went north East??! What kind of false advertisement is this?
There are never as many passengers needing wheelchairs getting off a @SouthwestAir flight as there are getting on. Was the 3rd A group passenger but 30 people boarded ahead of me. What’s the point of A-list?
@SouthwestAir This was a preventable problem.
@SouthwestAir what’s the operational time goal for baggage to arrive at baggage claim? If it’s under 30 minutes you’re 0/2 today on my flights. #WN1198
I want to be upset by how delayed my @SouthwestAir flight is but your employees are too nice so I’ll just tweet about it because It’s easier I am sad take me home
worst experience ever today on @SouthwestAir ! after waiting 45min for my bag to appear on the conveyer belt, i find out my checked bag was left at my transfer location due to “aircraft weight issues” when the flight wasn’t even packed!
@SouthwestAir I've sent a DM. Thank you again for your help!
Also @SouthwestAir kudos to y’all’s flight attendants for responding quickly and helping the kid out and not making a huge deal about it so that he wasn’t embarrassed
@SouthwestAir Still lame it took almost an hour to get my bags 😴
do you think @SouthwestAir will pay me bc they delayed my flight three hours and I had to book a hotel instead of driving home tonight bc our original 12:10 am arrival is now a 2:50 am arrival? I’ve been in this airport for so long I am so tired
@SouthwestAir can I use a backpack as a carry on and have my smaller backpack as my personal item? Or does a carry on have to be a luggage box?
@SouthwestAir Hi Amanda, thank you for getting back to me. I haven't been helped yet.
@SouthwestAir I suppose you can’t really say yes definitively but how about trying ... is there a pretty good chance you’ll still be flying to Belize through November? When will you release your schedule further than Aug?
I am pissed at @SouthwestAir boarded a flight in CLE for Ft Lauderdale to arrive at 1:15, weather in ATL sent me through four states to get to my destination. Now I board a ship tomorrow with no clothes, swimsuit, toiletries, etc 😡😡😡
And YES I'm taking stuff back. She has free luggage here too! I flew @SouthwestAir and I get two FREE CHECKED BAGS. I'm gonna take a luggage full of stuff back. One of them is about to be heavy as fuck.
Just watched a mom on @SouthwestAir absolutely destroy a random man on the plane who was rude to her teenage daughter and frankly she deserves a medal (or at least a drink).
@SouthwestAir Can anyone tell me when traveling to Cuba you are allowed 2 checked bags 50lbs. Is that 50lbs per bag, also, how much if the bag weighs a few more pounds, is there a charge for baggage when arriving in Cuba.
Hey @SouthwestAir, Dm me real quick. Got a question in regards to a flight :)
@SouthwestAir you were doing great. now we’ve waited a half hour for one passenger to connect. this is stupid. thanks!
@SouthwestAir Why is 2156 delayed??? Plane is full take off already. It's late enough.
@SouthwestAir Scored half a dozen delays recently, even 5-delay-in-a-row. Southwest defines it not the typical case for issuing voucher (as all less than 1-hr). Then what is? Got standard (and annoying) responses from social team every time, 'hoping' future ones would be good.
@SouthwestAir we are literally a whole hour behind.. I’m really pissed off. You gotta do better
@SouthwestAir Happy New Year! I love your brand and would love to find some creative ways to work together. Please send me a direct message. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir Drink service severely delayed, now sitting on the runway at the destination for 20 minutes with no clear answer to when we will go to the gate. Overall horrible experience.
Why is a Troop looking for a seat @SouthwestAir i will stay behind!!! Shame on you
By the way I’m waiting to get on another bitch ass @SouthwestAir plane so this should be fun
@SouthwestAir flight was supposed to take off from BWI at 9:30, still sitting at the gate at 10:42 PM waiting on luggage. Please get your shit together, this is a joke.
@SouthwestAir flight 1246 delayed then no crew to load the luggage. Ridiculous. You already price gouged us with these holiday fares! ($1200rt) At least get us where we are going more or less on time. #southwest #DoYourJob
@SouthwestAir this has been my 3rd delayed flight in the past two weeks! I am highly upset. Maybe I should’ve flown Delta 🙄
@SouthwestAir Not the best way to start the year! My favorite airline I’ve already got 8 flights planned with y’all this year too!
idk who it is but shoutout to the crew on @SouthwestAir flight 1465 from Denver to Dulles, this flight's had bloody noses and all kinds of shenanigans but y'all just keep bringing us the snacks
Every @SouthwestAir flight I've been on lately only has the crappy crackers. I wish they still offered peanuts or something good
@SouthwestAir Don't recommend at all - misleading web pricing cost me 2x original price when changing 1 day earlier. If it would have been more clear - I wouldn't have changed. Cust Svcs could offer nothing - no change back to orig flight or refund
@SouthwestAir shout out to your Baggage department in MCO!! I left my Passport, and all flying docs, on a flight from LAX to DEN. Someone found them and I have possession of them again. Pass along my thanks, I'll bring doughnuts next time I'm in MCO :)
@SouthwestAir please respond to my dm!
@SouthwestAir Oh nice! Thank you! See you tomorrow :D
@SouthwestAir now I tried just cancelling &amp; rebooking, paid the 20cent (LOL) difference via PayPal &amp; then got an error message. Tried again, paid the 20 cents again &amp; got an error msg! Halllpppp lol!!!!!
This route from Minneapolis to Chicago always feels like a quick hop. Now for the longer flight to Philadelphia. @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir At least the pretzels are fresh. LOL
@SouthwestAir where do I report poor service .. this is ridiculous
This is the 4th delay and I just want to get in my own bed. I'm on my last leg and @SouthwestAir got ya girl out here looking weary and restless.
Ugh. Where is flight 1251 baggage @SouthwestAir
I have to give @SouthwestAir major props! I’ve never seen pilots from another airline help with wheelchairs, but every time I fly Southwest the pilots are helping push chairs. I love it! #SouthwestAirlines #SWA690
@SouthwestAir I’m trying to see a agent about my luggage but there isn’t anyone where . My luggage has been damage
worst etiquette ive ever fucking been apart of ive gotten numerous “bag checks” after ive already checked bags like you shit employees do n not once have i had anything stolen from meYOUR FORM EVEN SAYSALL ITEMS REMOVED FOR SEARCH ARE PUT BACK WHERe THEY WERE FOUND @SouthwestAir
Boutique hotel has no desk. So I’ve been waiting outside for delivery of my bag since 8:15, when they told me it was leaving FLL (4.5 miles away). Just got a helpful update that it will arrive some before midnight.... #NeverflySWA @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir help! I just realized I used my maiden name instead of my married name. My passport &amp; DLis in my married name (ooops! I haven’t used maiden name in 17yrs!)
@SouthwestAir 🙌🙌 to crew on flight 1500 (1/2/20) TPA to CMH- flight attendant was so funny giving preflight directions and also took a minor flying by herself under her wing when they noticed her tears while boarding! First class attention and compassion!
@SouthwestAir hey! I'm trying to get some help fixing a name on my flight reservation and I need to get ahold of someone to do so. Is there an email or way I can?
Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir Checked in, went through TSA, waited at gate patiently and we overhear another passenger ask the gate attendant when we will board and she says “oh! This flight 968 is cancelled”. All the boards and the app say DELAYED
Still waiting for @SouthwestAir to deliver my clubs. I checked 1 bag this morning at 4:30am. Lost at least 3 hours of my holiday dealing with SWA incompetence. Meter is still running on that....
@SouthwestAir we have been waiting for our bags for over 30 minutes at Oakland Airport and no one can tell us what is going on.
@SouthwestAir Bags in hand, 9:06. So 26 minutes. Better.
@SouthwestAir please tell me why there were toenail clippings under my seat....
@SouthwestAir hey guys! What happened with flight 2502 connection today!? Very disappointing!
@SouthwestAir 20 would be reasonable...we landed tonight at 8:40, so we’re at 21 minutes and counting this evening. Very few flights here at BWI so let’s see how this one goes?
@SouthwestAir the worst thing about not getting bags / customer service folks could care less - Houston Hobby baggage claim - absolutely the worst!
@SouthwestAir shout out to Terry at Customer Service who went out of her way to answer questions about my daughters’ delayed flight and how to handle things if their connection was missed. She totally put my mind at ease!!
@SouthwestAir 45 minutes- still no bag. Houston hobby
@SouthwestAir 2 hours at baggage claim on the way out and now pushing 1.5 at my home airport baggage claim and filing a report for a lost bag now. Do better.
@SouthwestAir been waiting almost an hour for bags. Southwest didn’t do good for us tonight. #southwestairlines #customerservice
@SouthwestAir new record! Over 40 minutes and still no bag at Houston Hobby!!
@SouthwestAir incredible, 30 minutes later, still no bag ... You can walk the entire airport in 30 minutes 🙄
I knew you were sucking lately. You used to be a fun, great airline. Your jankity planes are small, old, squeaky and often in disrepair and the wireless almost never works. Your once funny employees are often cranky and snarky. @SouthwestAir
Hey @SouthwestAir why do car seats come out last well after the rest of the luggage? Doesn’t make sense to have a bunch of exasperated parents hanging around bag claim; wouldn’t you want to get them and their travel weary kids out of the airport ASAP for everyone’s benefit?
@SouthwestAir I didn’t have the option on your website
Although our flight got delayed over 3 hours Wednesday I must say @SouthwestAir handled the situation smoothly and always has the nicest flight crew to the point that my fiancée said she was surprised I wasn’t upset 😂 #SouthwestAirlines
@SouthwestAir just want to say thank you to the incredible Laurie (133025) at LAX departures for being an incredible professional and representative of SWA. I am an A-List preferred member and she's fantastic.
@SouthwestAir Houston Baggage Claim ... Still the worst! Amazing ...
@SouthwestAir is there an email or way I can get ahold of someone to fix a name on my flight reservation? I'd really appreciate it!
@SouthwestAir seems like either the vehicle that provides pushback from the gate or some other vehicle near the plane bumped the plane a few times here at Love Field? Flight 933 from Pittsburgh, Gate 7, landed ~30 minutes ago. Curious on what that was!
Dear @SouthwestAir just sent you a DM with some questions
@SouthwestAir Hi! If I’m changing my flight and the one I need is cheaper than the original, which gives me a credit, can I apply that to early bird check in?
@SouthwestAir is there a way to find out what has been edited out of movies? how is that decided? love that you have some a24 films listed, but i'd hate to try one and miss out on content that is important
@SouthwestAir Really. An aircraft swap after working a hour? Is the crew going to time out?
@SouthwestAir Hiyaa can you let me know the maximum weight limit for carry on?
Currently listening to our flight attendant Brian’s dad jokes on our @SouthwestAir flight to NYC. Not mad.
@SouthwestAir She filed. But no one turned them in yet :( so bummed for her.
@SouthwestAir I went so far out of my way to help w/ giving up my seats for your overbooked holiday travel. Finally sat down for the delayed leg of my return home flight... floor is coated in an unknown goo and my leather is ruined. Can’t make this stuff up 😐🤦🏽‍♂️📉
@SouthwestAir Always a great flight! In vegas safe, off to tampa shortly 🤗
@SouthwestAir Your leadership is a long way from Herb. I liked SWA when they actually gave a shit about their loyal customers. From a “About to former 15-20 year loyal customer” if you truly believed and executed on that quote above then I would get a decision maker to call me directly.
@SouthwestAir y’all are an absolute trash airline.
i keep trying to register for @SouthwestAir Rapid Rewards and it just keeps telling me “a password for this user already exists” and when I try to “recover” my “password” it says they’re unable to validate my information. I don’t know what to do anymore.
@SouthwestAir if your connecting flight happens to arrive early enough to get on an earlier flight (not full) to the same destination, we don’t have to pay the cost difference between the flights do we?
@SouthwestAir It took 40 minutes to get bags out. Like I said, I love you guys, but that is an area for improvement.
@SouthwestAir flight 2084 disappoints with last second mechanical delay.
@SouthwestAir cancelled my pre-scheduled flight and I’m pissed!!!
Nothing like stale pretzels... both bags. Yuck! @SouthwestAir #2006 #DCAtoMDW
@SouthwestAir Didn’t hear back from you Kaileigh? How do you want to proceed?
@SouthwestAir Cannot believe it has been a yr. and I always loved that guy and his story 😎
Ok @SouthwestAir we had smoke from our engines while taxiing. Had to be towed in, deplane, reboard a different plane and are delayed for nearly 3 hrs. Could badgermama and her 142 peeps at least get a free cocktail or wifi to calm nerves? SW1066.
@SouthwestAir Awesome, thanks for quick reply
@SouthwestAir I need to buy tickets for 2 adult and 1 infant, should i first book flight for adults and then call you guys to include infant or make reservation over the phone?
@SouthwestAir I'm counting on y'all flying me from Tucson to all those #barefootbluejeannights ✈❤ Thanks Katy!
Last 3 @SouthwestAir flights I’ve taken have been delayed. I understand it happens, but it shouldn’t be this often.
@SouthwestAir No i know that! It is just that even with a connection it says for the getaway tickets they’re unavailable, but the economy plus are.. connecting through Denver. But is says it for every day i look. Monday-tuesday etc
Yo @SouthwestAir s/o to the salty lady at gate 20 at love. Really fudged my boarding position. She’s the best! Give her a raise.
@SouthwestAir real casual announcement that we won’t have WiFi on this 4 hour flight. Most passengers rely on this. You don’t provide TVs. What do you expect us to do?
@SouthwestAir told me after saying they won't reimburse the $556 they cost my family for canceling our flight that "the conversation is over". Trust me, it is FAR from over. I have never been treated so poorly by any business I've ever encountered.
@SouthwestAir So why would you give 6 months status to a Chase Cardholder over 15 plus years of loyalty? BTW- I too got the SWA card via Chase but didn’t get the hookup. Why is that? Where is the integrity in that?
@SouthwestAir thank you for working with me through this delay. I hope my initial frustration wasn’t too extra. #transFAIRency #MyAirline #SWTheVeryBest #AustinTX
So even when @SouthwestAir says boarding is complete, it's not. Flight's delayed because of some late-bees. Being patient. I could have been one of those, but LET'S GO!
@SouthwestAir Yeah I'm at the gate now 😭😭😭😭😭 everyone here LOVES the note you gave me. Leaving home for work....
@SouthwestAir after 15 years of earning A-List/A List Preferred this is the first year I didn’t quite make the cut. I asked for a 3 month challenge to help me get back my status and I found out on TPG blog you gave some people with a Chase card status through June?Disappointed
I love @SouthwestAir in general. The aircraft and staff on-board are great, but I'm equally appalled by what transpired yesterday. I moved from FL to IN to prepare for the Bar, and moved my essentials along with me. I repeatedly insisted the staff at the airport to put Fragile
@SouthwestAir “Some” of the game? More like a majority of the game since it’s the 4th quarter but thanks for your kind words. It definitely make up for the money I spent on an airfare and the ticket to the game.
Shout out to Tim at the @SouthwestAir check-in desk at the Buffalo airport. You saved the day!
@SouthwestAir How considerate. Is this a joke.
@SouthwestAir hi! Why are the ‘GetAway’ tickets from Omaha to Oklahoma not available? I need to book a flight
Erin from @SouthwestAir says that they simply cannot reimburse me for the $556 I was forced to spend to make sure my daughter got onto a flight she was already originally booked on. Literally had to buy an extra ticket. $556 is NOTHING to Southwest but EVERYTHING to my family.
@SouthwestAir is there a way to receive notices on deals for specific cities? Like LAX/Nashville?
@SouthwestAir Even as a former i AM Always a solider of LuV!!! I will continue to spread the Love to all who cross my path on this journey!!! I drank the whole pitcher of Orange Kool~Aid...Don't tell but the mustache may give it away...SMiLES
@SouthwestAir apparently made a resolution for 2020 to rival Spirit Airlines for worst treatment of customers. UPDATE: Southwest has an early lead.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the delayed response. We already landed but the game is pretty much over so thanks for nothing
@SouthwestAir solutions for their customers inconveniences, cancel flights, massive added expenses, and lost luggage... $150 voucher to fly with them again. But no reimbursement or genuine apology. 🤔
@SouthwestAir loses our bag for 3 days at the beginning of our trip, cancels our flight home at the end of a trip, and forces us to spend an additional $556 for an expired companion pass as a result of the cancellation. Their remedy? $150 voucher. 🤔 #southwestlogic
@SouthwestAir says they won't reimburse me $556 for a ticket I was forced to purchase on 1/1/20 for a companion pass (free) flight that they cancelled on 12/31/19 with no other options for our family, almost leaving us stranded for the holidays with no way home.
@SouthwestAir My husband is been disabled since birth - 65 years - but you don’t allow him to board early without prior approval... so that doesn’t ‘fly’ with us.
@SouthwestAir, very disappointed. After paying $700 for a DOMESTIC flight (thats normally $250) I was told I had to pay change fees because this was a ‘discounted fare.’ This is by far the most I’ve ever paid to fly anywhere within the US and Southwest isnot supposed to have fees
@SouthwestAir hi I need help. Im on a ship and can't call yet and chat is showing all reps down.
SW 60, flight from SF to LV: excellent flight attendant on the intercom. A++++ give him a raise @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Transfarency? As a LOYAL a-preferred companion status member I just had the WORST experience ever. Your points redemption policy is flawed and I feel wronged and taken advantage of. Tough experience to start the year.
@SouthwestAir My boss didn't like that. ..
@SouthwestAir Flew DEN-MCO today, but no points are showing up yet. That is odd because in the past, they would show up about 30 minutes after the flight landed.
@SouthwestAir if your flights are open seating, what am I supposed to do when a passenger in the aisle seat (full flight) would not move for my child and I to sit there in the empty seats next to him? I was told the seats were open but then it depended on who would sit there?!
Hey @SouthwestAir I’ve traveled with you guys a lot over the last few years and have NEVER received drink coupons. I figured it was bad luck but my friend said she was flagged as underage since she signed up at 17. Should I call and update my account?
Thank you, @SouthwestAir, for allowing my kid and husband to board early at MSP today because you saw that she was nervous that they weren't going to be able to sit together. It was a tough visit to see Grandpa with advanced Alzheimer's and your wonderful staff helped. Thank you
Hey @SouthwestAir we are planning on coming home from Disneyland. Can we bring our lightsabers onto the plane or does it need to be checked in? :) May the force be with you, always.
@SouthwestAir DCA to FLL redirected to PBI
@SouthwestAir I was one of those idiots who left some things on the plane... what are my next steps?.
@SouthwestAir Your work isn’t paying off.
@SouthwestAir just had the best experience with Michelle at SNA. She helped me rebook my flight and was so kind. ❤️SWA!!!
@SouthwestAir fails AGAIN! On 1st trip they lost moms rolator. Now refuse to put it in bag To protect moving parts + sole mode of transport. Agent acts like I’m the jerk for requesting bag! Drag luggage to screening! No valu of elderly passengers! #southwestfail #elderly
biggest pet peeve: @SouthwestAir flyers who dnt follow the boarding process. if ur B57 stay where u belong dnt jump to the front &amp; bring ur friends there r families &amp; people who line up correctly &amp; aren’t too nice to say anything so have some respect &amp; check in earlier next time
Hey @SouthwestAir maybe you should do some training in Montego Bay. Who needs business select when you can just pre-board for no reason. Close to 40 people WALKED on the plane before A-1.
@SouthwestAir when you gonna hook us up with real credit card promotions? 40K points is child’s play.
@SouthwestAir 45 minutes and counting to get bags ... no running.
I’ll be flying @SouthwestAir today for the first time ever. I’ve heard many good things about them. Looking forward to experiencing it firsthand. MDW to LAS.
@SouthwestAir Puh-lease. Save the tweet. Do the service.
dear @SouthwestAir i am a loyal customer but y’all have done me WRONG today. this is ridiculous.
Oakland @SouthwestAir baggage might just be the worst on the planet. 1 and 1/2 hour flight and 45 minutes, and counting, for baggage ?
@SouthwestAir Hi Southwest. Why is WN652 being redirected?
@SouthwestAir I'm trying to change part of my flight but it's stating there is an error, even though I selected the flight..how can I get help with that?
@SouthwestAir I was giving a compliment. No inconvenience at all!
Another understaffed check in gate @SouthwestAir in LGA with a 45 minute line. This is getting old. Like we understand it’s the holidays but you should plan accordingly.
@SouthwestAir You know what...what you are saying is the obvious!!! But Thank you
@SouthwestAir how long does it take to transfer points from one account to another?
@SouthwestAir Well if there is a full flight and no one wants to sit next to the animal then what? I just suffer the whole flight! OK
@SouthwestAir hi - how do I change my preference on RR to get free drink coupons? Thank you!
@SouthwestAir Crossing my fingers that this will work lol
Hey @SouthwestAir , I bought a ticket for a friend but used her maiden name instead of married name. How can I change that?
Love the New travel funds tab. whats next. I mean all you give us is free bags, no change fees, no cancel fees and top flight travel experience...cant wait to see how you top yourself. @SouthwestAir
Hey @SouthwestAir, shout-out to FA Tina on #1865 MKE-DEN today. She was pure joy. That’s how you do customer service. Thanks for the lift!
@SouthwestAir can I girl get a A list hook up though!?
@SouthwestAir I don't wanna go back today... Can you tell me boss that I can't leave just yet
@SouthwestAir part 2. For what it’s worth, flew Delta &gt;90 segments last year and never had this issue.
@SouthwestAir Ok. Just send DM to southwest. Thank you
Thanks @SouthwestAir for the unexpected A-List status. That was a nice surprise to start 2020.
I’m on a @SouthwestAir flight to Memphis, &amp; I have the best seat mate. He walks up to the seat beside me &amp; says, “Hello ma’am, my name is Aiden. I’m flying alone. I know I am 12, but I won’t be a crying or screaming baby at least.” So anyway we are now best friends.
Hey autocorrect, there is never ever a time when I mean to text ‘ducking’ - never. Especially not when I’m experiencing my 3rd @SouthwestAir plane maintenance issue trying to get the duck out of Vegas
@SouthwestAir I noticed my accumulated points/miles have been stagnant over the past few months despite persistent use of my southwest rewards cc. Is there a reason for this? Please advise.
@SouthwestAir The seats were saved by the flight attendant! You don’t have a policy that prevents flight attendants from saving seats? I have flown Southwest for many a year, this is very disappointing to know. #SouthwestAir
Thanks @SouthwestAir Oakland for completely breaking my bag and having allllll my stuff fall out onto the conveyor belt.
@SouthwestAir My buddy and I got food poisoning while traveling near Washington DC and we're trying to figure out changing to an earlier departure tmw DCA-DAL. Hoping I can A-List standby on an earlier departure. Is there any way to get him on a standby list? Booked with points.
@SouthwestAir Yesterday flew ATL-RSW, hubby &amp; I tried to sit in row 23 but realized there were clothing items in the seats. We then had to chose 2 middle seats. A few people with position #’s AFTER ours went to the SAME row &amp; the attendant said “I saved these seats for you”. WTH?
@SouthwestAir why do I pay for TSA Precheck if you guys fail to put it on my boarding pass everytime I fly ?
Dear @SouthwestAir You’re one of the 2 airlines I trust whole heartily, thank you #LoveYou #SouthWestAirlines #SouthWestAir
@SouthwestAir accidentally went to JetBlue to file a claim for my bag and they were ready to replace my bag right on the spot. SW baggage office at CHS wouldn't even entertain my concern and sent me away 😕
@SouthwestAir flew from FTL to CHS on Dec 20 w/a brand new suitcase w/4 wheels. rec'd my bag with 3 wheels...4th wheel was completely ripped off. baggage office told me they dont file claims for rips tears &amp; wheels bcuz it's cosmetic. wth?
@SouthwestAir What A Legacy He Left. May Herb’s Name Be For A Blessing ✈️💐
@SouthwestAir Thanks Jeremy. I’ll give it a try
@SouthwestAir you guys are killing me. Can’t believe the email I received last night basically saying “tough luck”. We give you guys so much business and so many referrals.
@SouthwestAir that’s a whole 4 hours !!! I could drive to Las Vegas in this time lol.
@SouthwestAir I spoke with him on the the hallway that connects the tarmac to the terminal. Of your like me to ID him and tell you what he looks like and said to me, let me know😊
@SouthwestAir Ask the pilot of that flight who was behind me and terrorizing the entire plane.
@SouthwestAir can you tell me when you will post travel for August 14th 2020?
@SouthwestAir I'm still on the phone with SWA and getting nowhere. I'll DM you now. This is a pathetic way to treat an A-list member.
Hey @SouthwestAir, where on your website can I find the expiration date for my Rapid Rewards points?
@SouthwestAir you called me 4 days ago to bump me due to an oversold flight. I said no. Today, you bumped me and told me there is nothing you can do &amp; your customer service is abysmal today. Contact me asap. I'm a frequent SW flyer but that will change if this doesn't get sorted.
Perhaps related... @SouthwestAir has given me a $100 voucher good for a year. So thanks! But also, please no more turbulence like that xD
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the reply, Kj thought that was pretty cool! #CustomerService #Southwest #madeakidsday #madeadadsday
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the link! The website still lists it as a non-stop route....not sure if that's an error or the usual flights will be added later?
@SouthwestAir I sent it in a message
@SouthwestAir hey guys! Is there anyway to find how many miles I Flyed last year for a year end round up? Thank you!!
I am so bummed. @SouthwestAir has always been my go to airline. I’m going to have to consider a different company. I cannot get behind their unused travel funds policy. Not even for a loyal customer will they extend the expiration by 2 months. #ItWasFunWhileItLasted #AirlinesSuck
@SouthwestAir are you still doing nonstops to/from SNA -&gt; DAL? It's my favorite route &amp; there aren't any listed for 2020! 🙏🏻✈️❤️
@SouthwestAir Thanks for answering! I try to fly with you guys from SJU as frequent as possible, but the two hour drive +tolls +parking sometimes isn’t worth it when having a big airport 10 minutes away from home. It’s the same for many in the west. For tourists, we offer the best beaches!
@SouthwestAir Can't believe it's been a year..We miss you Herbie!
@SouthwestAir Your agents are not helpful and have just given us a letter that the bags will be delivered at a certain time. We need fair compensation because we have things in our bags that we need for the baby!!!
@SouthwestAir He was an amazing man. He is missed by us passengers too.
@SouthwestAir thanks for taking away my A boarding and moving it to dead last that’s really good
@SouthwestAir Who do I contact to have them replaced? I am a priority member and have been using SWA for over 10 years.
@SouthwestAir Now the baggage agent is saying that our bags are in LA and not in Oakland. So disappointed! Also we are traveling with a toddler. I hope you understand
Thanks @SouthwestAir for the surprise A-List status!! Nobody does nice things like that anymore
@SouthwestAir just waited in line at DIA to check bags for over an hour. Snarky employee told me that my bags not being on my flight is my fault for not being there even earlier than I was. So being there 2 hours early isn't early enough?
@SouthwestAir disappointed that our bags are missing. Almost half an hour since we landed from flight WN955
A little disappointed @SouthwestAir I’ve been a companion pass (over 100 flights) for a while but you’re ticket agent Albany considered this an extra carry on. Even though it would have easily fit behind my carry-on in the bin. Thus charging me $75 (since I had to check 3
@SouthwestAir Will always choose you guys for my domestic flights! Keep up the amazing work!!
A belated but notable 'thank you' to @SouthwestAir for another uneventful, on-time flight last night. Your team did great as usual. #LUV
@SouthwestAir He is still spreading the LUV in the skies!!!
@SouthwestAir Be great if SWA could return to the days of Herb, it has gone down hill since.
@SouthwestAir I gave your agent all the information and details. I don’t have receipts for my luggage!!! Who keeps receipts for luggage. There was 8 of us traveling you have all the info. What it boils down to is the tweet from you are for show on twitter. SW needs to do the right thing.
On personal note I got a killer deal on round trip tickets to Cailfornia today. Thanks to @SouthwestAir taking a mini vaca to see my kids and granddaughter.
I’m sad to announce the passing of my... @SouthwestAir A-List Preferred Status 😢 on January 1, 2020. Can we please have a moment of silence? #NotEnoughTravelIn2019
@SouthwestAir Appreciate the reply, Jeni. There’s opportunity to learn here. Delays happen for a number of reasons, understood. Passengers were frustrated by rushing on when all was not ready. When it’s not weather and it’s on SWA, throw a few miles at us on our accounts. Goes a long way.
@SouthwestAir No worries, I 💙💛 y’all! You aren’t responsible for people choosing to be rude!
Now this plane having technical difficulties. Imma be looking for my $100 voucher @SouthwestAir
Thanks to Jimmy in Albuquerque @SouthwestAir for his amazing customer service when I needed it most. Because of people like you, I’m a Southwest girl for life.
@SouthwestAir What about grandparents and understanding the need to board with the rest of the family...?
@SouthwestAir is still the best airline hands down. Two free checked bags and our pilot got us to Cleveland 20 min early. Can't beat it.
@SouthwestAir Consideration?? Really?? I have already spent more than a hour trying to create a report only to get a email from you saying claim denied!
@SouthwestAir You should do the right thing. How in the world do wash a suitcase that smells like mildew???
Sitting in Nashville on @SouthwestAir when I’m supposed to be in Atlanta. Updated schedule shows getting in after connecting flight leaves. Not sure when I’ll make Ft Lauderdale. There goes my Airbnb room $$.
@SouthwestAir come on man what y’all got going on at Orland Airport
@SouthwestAir I pay $50 round trip early bird months ago and only get B15, then more than 40 families get on, basically pushing me to C class? This stinks!
@SouthwestAir will not be getting my business. Read their contract of carriage and company policy. You are screwed if they ruin your clothes, hairdryer and luggage.
So it appears that if @SouthwestAir submerses your suitcases in water on 12.27.19 they are not responsible for the damage to your suitcase smelling like mildew or your dyson hairdryer getting damaged. We spent the 1st day of vacay washing.Choose another airline.
@SouthwestAir I kid, I kid. Love me some Southwest 😘✈️
Welp, I checked in too late into my @SouthwestAir flight and now I’m waiting to board at position C19. Gonna prepare to say hi to my aisle and window neighbors
@SouthwestAir Flight 2371 schedule to leave from Austin at 930 actually left on time! We love an on time flight 🥳
Raise your hand if open seating with @SouthwestAir gives you anxiety. Will I be stuck in a middle seat, will I be next to other people, will I be stuck in a seat that doesn’t recline? So many questions and so little control
If you can’t have peanuts due to peanut allergies on a plane, why is it ok to bring a dog on the plane if people have an allergy to dogs? @SouthwestAir
Huge shoutout to @SouthwestAir for flexibility in flights!!! Thank you!
@SouthwestAir We traveled in June of 2016 would our points still be available? Also they were under my husband's name and he passed June 2016 is there anyway for me to access them
Wow, @SouthwestAir is not starting 2020 on my good side.
@SouthwestAir I received an email about an upcoming flight change that I did not book. I think it’s spam but would like to confirm. Can someone help?
Not even trying to be mean here but if you’re so obese that you take up one and a half seats on a plane you should be required to buy 2 seats so that people with normal BMI don’t have to be uncomfortable the whole flight... @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Ok, thanks for quick responses this early morning. Stay safe and have a great day!
@SouthwestAir Ok, so the OAK-PVR direct route still exists? I could not find if either when I looked for flights earlier. Traveling back to California from PVR next week and was stunned I had to go via HOU or DEN to get to LA, effectively making it an 8-11 hr journey.
@SouthwestAir All squared away now, I appreciate your concern and don’t blame SW. I blame all the parents flying with kids #leaveyourkidsathome
@SouthwestAir That’s a bummer. How about direct flights to PVR from any of the airports in the Bay Area - SFO, SJC and OAK - are they gone as well?
@SouthwestAir Southwest customer service is always the best. Thank you for remedying the issue! :)
@SouthwestAir Wow! Already got a text about the refund! Thank you! Always amazing customer service
@SouthwestAir Ok I'll call then. Thank you
Missed my flight due to insane baggage lines @SouthwestAir any chance you would like to credit me my early bird check in? 😞
@SouthwestAir I’m not trying to complain at all, but it would be nice if you changed your military boarding procedure as most military members are trained not to fly in uniform for security purposes. Other than that, keep up the good work 😊
Note to self.. allow for 3688654377 hours of waiting in line for @SouthwestAir bag check if you don’t wanna miss your flight
@SouthwestAir I’ve never complained for any carrier delays, but this is 100% SWAs fault. Southwest Airlines has lost what made them special. We will never fly with them again, work or personal
Hey @SouthwestAir — my direct flight was cancelled &amp; our 3 hr travel time doubled 😭 help
Flight 616 PHX to KC. For the first time in 4 years they didn't board military. @SouthwestAir interesting.
@SouthwestAir Time isn’t the issue, AC on this plane is...Sweating bullets 🥵
Alright, time to turn the AC on in this plane...🥵✈️ @SouthwestAir
“If you are flying to Las Vegas on this aircraft via Raleigh to Fort Lauderdale to Denver to Atlanta To Vegas, we are happy to find you a new travel agent or provide you a map of the United States.” @SouthwestAir flight attendants got jokes early in the morning.
Southwest has to have the slowest bag check in I’ve ever seen! @SouthwestAir step up your game!
@SouthwestAir denia are u familiar with the concept of a meme
unless i’m flying int’l, i fly almost exclusively with @SouthwestAir. that’s been the case for the last 5 years. that’s about to change. their services are declining and have been for the last 12 months. y’all need to get it together. haven’t had a smooth flight in months.
Thank u @SouthwestAir ! Had to cancel trip last minute due to son's illness and u made it so easy! No penalties or extra fees. That's true #transfarency! #Southwestisbest
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your exceptional service and efficiency !!! #Philadelphia #tampabay
@SouthwestAir put out the push notification that our plane was boarding about 15 min early and now people are running to the gate. Only to find it still closed bc we haven’t started. Looks kind a scene from Home Alone!
@SouthwestAir travel with them frequently. Flying out for funeral today at 520 am &amp; return tonight. Would not allow me to check in for return flight. Now I have C boarding. Ugh.
@SouthwestAir, what the heck? Flight 3259 from San Diego to Denver two hours late getting in? It's 2:47 and still waiting for my bag at DIA #workinginthemorning
@SouthwestAir We have been waiting for our luggage for an hour. I think they forgot to unload flight 1790 from Honolulu. I think you have a riot on your hands. Pathetic. I know I won’t be the only one complaining. Lol.
@SouthwestAir First time using Twitter to complain about anything but the #southwestagent wanted to give me a complaint form instead of talking with me. #flight1790 #stillwaiting #nolove. Over an hour now.
@SouthwestAir When you ask about the bags you would think you would get a different response than do you want a complaint form.
@SouthwestAir No they don’t. Oakland is terriable! My airport, A List Preferred. It takes at least 30 minutes every time. You own employee even said “ This is normal for Oakland.”
@SouthwestAir no announcement, nothing. #stillWaiting #Flight1790 #Flight1790Still #nolove. CRAZY! Southwest employee- “This is normal for Oakland.” How long are we going to put up with this. #nobags. Over 45 minutes. Southwest employee “do you want a complaint form.” Yes!
@SouthwestAir why does it take over 40 minutes to get your bag at the Oakland airport? When you ask Southwest employees the ask if you want a complaint form. #Flight1790 #stillWaiting
@SouthwestAir Did you send my complaint letter to your executive office?
@SouthwestAir Thanks I appreciate it, some stuff has sentimental value though. The last incident was a suitcase I purchased in Paris, France in 2018 also a huge purchase.
@SouthwestAir Hi Tayler, not acceptable. You all put us in a hotel, and then canceled the flight you re-booked me for. I’ve been on hold for 40 minutes while your team is workin to “rebook” me for a flight 8 hours from now, that I can rebook myself on your app if I was willing to pay for it.
Why is it that when I fly @SouthwestAir my luggage is damaged? 1x flew home, my gram passed, didn't notice the damage until days later when I was packing again. Just recently, they lost my luggage, next day delivered w/ damage, didnt C it til I was packing again. #DoBetter #wtf
Got screwed over by @SouthwestAir tonight 😭😭. Flight delayed 2 hours, crazy boarding situation, now we're on the plane just waiting some more. I'm tired and just want to be home already!!!! 😭😭😭
@SouthwestAir You got us a new flight...tomorrow morning, but that somehow just automatically canceled because it was attached to the connection we could not make. I love Southwest, but this is unbelievable.
@SouthwestAir Y’all should get a few A318s, or A319s. See how they are. And then go from there. The 737 is old reliable but what about a change?
This year's first flight with @SouthwestAir is smooth. I hope the same continues for the rest.
@SouthwestAir It wasn't typical, but it was widespread. Several of your airport employees were subpar today.
Exactly on the minute 24 hours before our @SouthwestAir flight tomorrow and get B35 😭 #southwest #howdoesthismagicwork it’s like a magic eight ball
#CustomerService e @SouthwestAir ?Same day DEN2OGG on 1ticket then 2-3 hours later the same day I'm flying from OGG2HNL on a separately purchased ticket. my final destination from Denver is Honolulu. can you check my bag all the way through from DEN to HNL?
@SouthwestAir 42 mins is never okay, I do not care how many flights are coming in.
OMMFG! Our flight landed at 10:50, and it’s 11:33 and we STILL don’t have our bags @SouthwestAir this is so damn ridiculous
@SouthwestAir my upcoming flight says I don't qualify to purchase an Early Bird In. Is there a time constraint on that? My flight is in less than 2 weeks.
Good Night Gratitude: making an impact, stolen moments in the sun, great deals on @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Yes, gladly! Thank you ✨
Wanted to let @SouthwestAir know I was on Flight 353 from Denver to BWI tonight. The cabin crew couldn’t have been more accommodating and professional, and the pilots did a great job steering us around the bumps. 10/10
I swear I can never have a successful trip with @SouthwestAir 😤
@SouthwestAir Disappointment happens when your flight is on time and the next minute it is delayed 90 minutes because you decide to give our plane to another flight and make us wait for a new plane 😡
@SouthwestAir Flight from SJC TO SEA delayed by 2 hours. I get to know abt it when I arrive at the check-in counter. No notifications from your app. So frustrating!!
@SouthwestAir flyway driven. Never fear though, we've flown Southwest since its start back at Love Field when we lived in Dallas and will continue to be a loyal flyer. Again, thank you for replying. Happy New Year and Happy Flying!
@SouthwestAir Thank you for replying. It makes no sense to have only 1 ground crew available when more than 1 flight is expected to arrive/depart an airport, even a small one like Clinton. We not only arrived early, which is great, and had to wait to be parked, but then had to wait to have the
You really test my patience and loyalty @SouthwestAir Not exactly starting off the new year in a good way. #imafreeagent
Katy @SouthwestAir twitter help desk is awesome!!! Thanks for everything!!!
@SouthwestAir I really hope you make this right... Flight 2141 trying to get to Reno
Woo! Exit row on LAS-SFO @SouthwestAir flight home. Leg room!
The Plane from SEA to PHX was full. Couldn’t sit with my son. Chad (“Chadwick”) put us on the next flight at my request. He was so quick and efficient and friendly and made sure we could PRBD so we would definitely be together. THANK YOU, CHAD AND @SouthwestAir great CS 🎉 ✈️ 🙏
@SouthwestAir Have you stopped with non-stop flights between PVR and LAX? Can’t find any after this week.
Normally, I am more than pleased with Southwest, but Flight 882 (MDW to RDU) made me feel differently. Gate agent, Lois, was the most austere, inhospitable, dismissive Southwest employee I have yet to encounter. I would suggest additional customer service training @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Wow you guys are quick, thanks! i just sent you my details via DM, thanks!
Shoutout to @SouthwestAir for giving me an airline voucher for treating a seizure patient at the airport, being thanked for just doing my job really means a lot 💙
@SouthwestAir I have my case number when you're ready.
About to have my first mental breakdown of 2020 in the Phoenix airport. Thank you @SouthwestAir 🙃
They put luggage from 4 flights on ONE carousel...🤦‍♂️💆‍♂️ @SouthwestAir surely there’s a better way...
You wanna know what hell is? Being on a 5 hour flight with screaming toddlers and NO WIFI! @SouthwestAir WTF?!?!
@SouthwestAir Hey guys, I flew with you on 12/24 and paid $8 for the wifi, but it stopped working after 20 minutes and wouldn't come back on for anyone. How can I get a refund?
@SouthwestAir Hopefully I can get some views like this ok my flight next weekend! I LUV SWA 💙❤️💛 hope to be working for y’all some day
Usually I swear by @SouthwestAir but it’s been a rough night on this flight. 20-minute delay was announced 12 hours before flight time, but were rushed on board like were leaving on time at 9:35...and now we’ve been sitting at the gate over an hour b/c of missing papers.
@SouthwestAir Plane was FULL from SEA to PHX .. they said I couldn’t sit with my son. No one would move 😲 .. “Chad” (Chadwick?) set us up and put us on the next flt at my request. Made sure we can pre board so we’ll definitely be seated together. THANK YOU❗️
@SouthwestAir lost our mom’s wedding dress from 35 years ago. And literally not one person from SW has helped in the last 5 days. What. Is. Going. On?
@SouthwestAir It wasn’t an announcement. Dm me and I can share your employees abhorrent behavior.
I could see a bunch of #StoryDam Writing Chat tweets in airplane mode with the @SouthwestAir app, but I couldn’t reply to y’all til now! (We just landed.)
AND I got my drink for free 😘 thanks @SouthwestAir
Worst flight ever! I’m so disappointed @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Evening Grayson, my issue lies in the fact that these are all mechanically based disruptions, not weather, which could be avoided through proper maintenance and yet here we are... #dissatisfied #SouthwestAirlines #southwest
When you travel kinda often it is the small things that make it easier, like this upgraded seatback situation on @SouthwestAir. 👍🏼to that design team. #smallerbutusabletray #placeforbook #butawayfromcoffee #easytoseemystuff
I left my jacket on my @SouthwestAir flight 😔 First fail of 2020 🥺
yo @SouthwestAir this is a nice flight I’m on
I received top notch customer service on the way to Charlotte. I should’ve known some mess would occur on my flight back. I’ve never been on a @SouthwestAir flight with no snacks or drinks? What? Some poor lady kids kept whining about being thirsty the entire flight.
Sooooo @SouthwestAir I paid $8 for WiFi to only have a plane that the WiFi goes in and out .... 2.5 flight this is gonna suck thanks southwest
@SouthwestAir I appreciate your replies. Here’s to fewer caregivers encountering this kind of thing and not being treated as if checking a car seat was a ridiculous thing to do. Sincere thanks.
@SouthwestAir Do flights booked using travel funds still earn rapid rewards points?
@SouthwestAir I'm a loyal customer, but the customer service today was horrendous from multiple levels!
.@SouthwestAir I’m looking for a small miracle here...do you have a lost &amp; found for kids stuffed animals?! We flew Christmas Day from Hartford to Orlando 11:30 departure. Help!
@SouthwestAir Hey, Kenzie! As I also wrote, why inconvenience families at all and add to the length and stress of travel with little ones when you can pull other types of cargo before car seats? Please take the suggestion into consideration and also - empathy!
That was the worst serviced @SouthwestAir flight I've ever been on.
@SouthwestAir please help. We just bought a gift card but were charged for 2. Called customer service got pointed to 3rd party company who pointed us right back
first time flying @SouthwestAir since i was a baby &amp; they put too much fuel on the plane, making us deplane &amp; board a new plane along with being delayed almost 2 hrs....
Hey @SouthwestAir - big shoutout to you all. We had an unexpected death in our family and your guy Anthony treated us so kind and fair. Thank you for customer service that is second to none.
@SouthwestAir However.. Their credit card is great 😃
@SouthwestAir I would have liked to been able to use the rewards I had but due to no cart service, being stranded I San Antonio in the middle of the night for 2xdays and having to finally take a train home my rewards expired 😭
Today’s the third time I’ve seen a family try to board together (parents, kids, and grandparents) only to see grandparents told they need to get in line. It bothers me because grandparents are old and they’re a part of the fam too. @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Our checked luggage was damaged during flight #2011 from Pittsburgh to ATL, and your website says we can only report in person before leaving the airport. What the heck??? #disappointed
@SouthwestAir i have a flight on 1/15 but my middle name isn't on the reservation. I read it has to match whats on the license. Will they let me through security or do i need to have you add my middle name?
Landed an hour ago. Still no bag @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir hey, is it true that I can bring something like a cardboard box as a checked luggage item as long as it meets the other requirements (under 50 pounds and under 72 linear inches)?
Airlines tell families “cargo is cargo” when removing car seats from flights to balance weight. @SouthwestAir you think it’s OK to allow babies and small children to ride in cars without car seats? You guys are supposed to be the last of the reasonable airlines!
@SouthwestAir why is my 10:45pm flight delayed until 12:15am??! I need a new flight!!
@SouthwestAir Can you have airport authorities at FLL in the Southwest terminals at the B gates turn off the air? It's freezing in here.
@SouthwestAir Thank you Amanda DM’ing you now!
Vegas at the of the month courtesy of being part of the rapid rewards program via @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir No, the line was extremely long and I had obligations.
@SouthwestAir our flight was delayed out of BUR to LAS. this delay will force us to cancel our dinner reservations that required $$ to hold. Any chance we can get on an earlier flight so we don’t miss out?
@SouthwestAir absolutely disgusted with how you handle YOUR SYSTEM error/failure and lack of customer service ( David #22 from Houston). Um, hello United, do you want a premier platinum customer back ?
@SouthwestAir Loved the dad joke. Made it in around 1 a.m. on the 1st. Happy New Year to you, Steve! :)
@SouthwestAir All good now. They’re supposedly on another plane a few hours from now.
Thank you @SouthwestAir for addressing my concerns so quickly. I appreciate your great customer service. I look forward to my next flight!
@SouthwestAir Can you provide assistance with a reservation? I have a trusted travel number, but did not receive a TSA PreCheck on my boarding pass.
@SouthwestAir Stop allowing folks to sit next to people with their PETS not in a carrier. This woman had her big ass dog in hand moving and shaking fucking hair everywhere! I couldnt even eat or get my drink.
@SouthwestAir Very angry that our flight (2845) was delayed 2 hours today because of a crew issue in New Orleans! Do you not plan crew schedules or something? I could understand weather delays but come on, get your sh** together!
@SouthwestAir is terrible, they don’t care about their customers. You should not do business with them. I’ve been working towards companion pass all year long, and spent the necessary amount of points by 12/31, and was told spending in December actually does not count #fraudalert
@SouthwestAir can you pleaseeee start having flights out of JFK or Newark?? It’d make life so much easier!! (And a non-stop to Fort Myers would be helpful too😉 )
@SouthwestAir can i bring an instant pot as a carry on 😅
@SouthwestAir My daughter accidentally left her iPhone on Southwest flight to ATL from LAX-3621. Can you help us?
@SouthwestAir Missed my flight due to my kid’s UPC code pulling up on your ap, then couldn’t print it either. Missed my connecting and now out of $170 and spending the night at the airport. Thanks for nothing Southwest, could’ve gotten me home for free
@SouthwestAir do strollers and car seats fly free?
@SouthwestAir Yes, but they aren’t technical and unable to resolve issues like this
@SouthwestAir you need to train your FA’s that there’s a fine line between cutesy and condescension. I don’t suppose that publicly shaming passengers is in the manual.
@SouthwestAir Hello! Last time I flew out of SNA, they made me buy a new wax box for my frozen food (which was already packed in a cardboard box so we ended up putting my box in box). Is there a way for me to obtain one in advance so I don't have to rush at the airport? Thanks!
@SouthwestAir Chelsea is AMAZING!!!! Thank you for rhe great customer service!!!!!
I’m confused as to why my duffle bag is drenched and all my clothes are soaked. I’m upset and annoyed @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir can you guys please help? My dad got kicked out of his flight back to Oakland and it is not fair to cancel that booking w/o any notice..
I think I’ve checked the @SouthwestAir app at least 243 time today trying to find a cheap flight to NOLA this weekend 😩
Honestly @SouthwestAir I waited 30+ mins to talk to someone for the agent to be super unhelpful and just uninterested in answering my questions.
@SouthwestAir You have an all-star crew on the 6:20PM PHL to MCO flight! So funny, kind and welcoming. Feels like a party 🥳
@SouthwestAir based on the announcement of the female gate agent at Gate C-11 at LAS, my take away is that Southwest doesn't care. Maybe Southwest should change its stock ticker symbol from LUV to DONTCARE.
Hey @SouthwestAir y’all take Kohl’s Cash?? 😂😂
Dear @SouthwestAir -Rocky is a #CustomerService #TitleHolder Many #Thanks give him an extra day off or some extra snacks! Thanks Again. #Travel #travelbloggers
@SouthwestAir Your one employee here wouldn’t say anything to a bunch of us from multiple flights except “I’ll announce which carousel when the bags from your flight are coming out.” Also, the signs say E6 while the bags are currently coming out at E8... Have one bag in hand and crossing (1/2)
Really frustrated with @SouthwestAir Canceled flight + tarmac wait + lost golf clubs on flight 6190 DAL to MDW + rude customer relations = reconsideration of my southwest loyalty. #plentyofotherairlines
This is the second time in three months when I find myself thinking that I should have flown @SouthwestAir.
@SouthwestAir I need help resetting my password
.@SouthwestAir trying to online check-in within 24 hrs of our flight, but website won’t let us without any explanation... Tried to call customer service, but wait time is 93 min... please help
@SouthwestAir Gate agent taking boarding passes for flight 456 from Tampa to Nashville would not allow my family member with ADA/Handicap card to board with pre-boarders - she needs extra time. Agent said that if she could walk down jetway, then she would have to wait to board???
@SouthwestAir I guess the flight attendants on my flight from MSY to AUS have decided to take this flight off? No turbulence at all. Shady and lazy.
Hey @SouthwestAir the Flight Attendants on DAL to HOU and then HOU to HAR weren’t very cheery today. 🥺Some of y’all got a case of the Thursdays? 😐 #WheresMySmile
@SouthwestAir another positive flying experience! Thank you! Both legs early!
@SouthwestAir please respond to my dms
@SouthwestAir where can I go a fill out a customer survey? I would love to give you all some feedback on your Full Service people here in Memphis, TN. I’m very displeased with my “customer service” today. Happy New Year 🥂
funny how @SouthwestAir hasn't emailed me their usual "how was your flight" post-travel survey but might be they don't want my answer after they didn't even get our car seat and stroller onto our first plane last week 🙄
@SouthwestAir not letting military preboard when we're not in uniform implies you only want the publicity of helping military. It's also super embarrassing when one flight let's out of uniform preboard, and another doesn't.
@SouthwestAir it was my friends first time flying SW and her luggage was lost. She had to wait until the next flight to come in with her luggage. My experiences have always been great which is why I always recommend SW.
Hi @SouthwestAir is there a way to get my TSA precheck even though it's not showing up on my boarding pass? Asking for my husband lol
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your help, Victoria!
@SouthwestAir What can you do to fix this?
@SouthwestAir any promo codes I can use?? I’m trying to book a roundtrip flight from sac to lax, but it’s 100$ more than my friends flying the same day from San Jose to lax.
@SouthwestAir is pretty good #airline with the lone exception of having to pay more 💵 to sit together if you’re #traveling together. Fix that shit southwest, you shouldn’t have to pay more to sit w/ loved ones.
@SouthwestAir Happy New Year! When will your August-Sept.2020 rates be available?
@SouthwestAir True. Just glad I hadn’t already paid for it. Was trying to give her the benefit of the doubt.
@SouthwestAir Yay! Looks like it will be clear skies for today’s flight! :)
@SouthwestAir Does Den have curbside check-in at Southwest?
@SouthwestAir hey friends, I bought wifi on my trip down to PHX yesterday and it didn’t work, can I get a voucher for my flight home today?
Buying early bird on an international @SouthwestAir flight is a crock. Every time I preload all the info, and when i go 8 hours after i could have checked in to see my boarding position, it hasn't checked me in and wants more info. #FirstWorldProblems
@SouthwestAir due to year end processing I can't see when my points expire. Any way you can retrieve (they're this month)? Also, can you purchase an extension?
@SouthwestAir I’ve been thinking about getting this Southwest Airlines credit card for sometime. Maybe 2020 is the year I do it!! #SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Missed my home for the holidays flight per emergency hospitalization. I have been unsuccessful in reaching an employee qualified to resolve this for a week. May I have a direct number to Customer Care?
@SouthwestAir here I sit again having to confess my sins... I have cheated once again and used the "dollar general" airlines of the sky. Buyers remorse. If you'll have me I'll never stay again..... #dollargeneralofthesky #loveplaneblues #cheater #remorse
Hey @SouthwestAir - any chance you might add flights between MKE and RSW in late March? Your nonstops on my flight dates are sold out and I’m sure you could fill several more 737s.
@SouthwestAir Of course it can be done. This is not the customer service and flexibility I and others enjoy about flying Southwest.
@SouthwestAir Hi Jennifer. It can be done.
@SouthwestAir may I please have the phone number for support regarding a difficult trip we had back home on 12/27/2019
@SouthwestAir i lost my wallet at houston hobby on Saturday, and i already filed a report but no one has gotten back to me. Please help, my passport is in there
@SouthwestAir Unfortunately you can assist me but refuse. Your corporate office is terrible and it does your entire airline a disservice as well as your customers.
@SouthwestAir Already have here in Denver. I have zero confidence it makes it on the next flight out.
"Bags fly free at the expense of good baggage handlers at certain airports" - @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir I am disappointed! I ALWAYS fly with you guys – because I am LOYAL, however, my flight has been delayed twice today! I had something very important that needed to get done, and now it can’t!! 😒😒😒😒
@SouthwestAir Hello, if I’m traveling with a newborn, will a photo of the birth certificate on my phone work or do I need to bring a physical copy? Thanks.
@SouthwestAir Going to Disney in Feb and will of course fly with you guys. It really does mean a lot, I wish I had wrote down all the people's names who have helped out there (its A LOT) Bar none the best airlines for our son and family.
.@SouthwestAir flight attendant over speaker: hey did anyone drop this?? *everyone pops up and looks* attendant: good, now we’ve got your attention for the safety features... well played
@SouthwestAir $40 voucher to cover a useless damaged $200+ stroller for an airline that won't take responsibility for their handlers.... why would I want to fly SW again...
@SouthwestAir liability limitations per Contract of Carriage doesn't make sense if your operators mishandled my stroller AFTER the flight, it was free from damage at that point. Your supervisors already claimed obvious fault at time of incident and now SW is denying the claim.
Hi @SouthwestAir ! We love you we would just like to chat about all of the wonderful ideas these 400+ folks have. Could you dm me someone contact in marketing? Would love to have a very positive conversation!
@SouthwestAir It did (obviously I don’t have that boarding pass anymore), but there nothing for a flight attendant to scan? *that I could see*
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the canned response 🙄
@SouthwestAir do you do support over twitter?
@SouthwestAir Ah sorry! I meant to select Skywest 😬
There are few thrills quite like getting an aisle seat on a @SouthwestAir flight without early check-in
Long story short, @SouthwestAir has saved me on multiple occasions now lol
What's the point of boarding groups if "Puts a bag in a seat" is all it takes to hold seats for other people? Never flying @SouthwestAir again.
@SouthwestAir Looking forward to a sky like this with you Wednesday morning! 🖤🙌🏽✈️
@SouthwestAir awesome!! thank you so much Holden! 😊
@SouthwestAir I got a flight refund via points Jan 29th 2019. I have until Jan 29th 2021 to use the points in my account, correct?
@SouthwestAir Flight 178 from Denver to Greenville departure has been delayed from 8:15 AM to 11:15 AM. No reason has been given. It can’t be weather as it’s a beautiful day. Is there any credit available for this inconvenience?
If @SouthwestAir business class has a free drink coupon, but you want to be somewhat economical and not get a paper boarding pass, how do you get your drink coupon? This will be my second BC upgrade, so I’m going to be prepared. #MKEtoONT
So @SouthwestAir has a fun new policy: they literally just change their schedule, and your itinerary with it, and your new itinerary is usually much, much worse than the one you selected, and *paid for* Fun seeing them become every bit the scumbag airline United is 😂
@SouthwestAir disappointed in the so called “Early Bird” check-in. Decided to splurge on it for my bachelorette trip. Got A60 while my sister, who didn’t get it, got A45... 🤔 Seems like a rip off.
@SouthwestAir when will you be posting flight schedules through the end of August? Thanks
@SouthwestAir quick question.i am in business select but my free drink coupon doesn’t show up with my boarding pass in the app. Has there been a change to the business select policy? Thanks
@SouthwestAir Negative. Wasn’t aware that there was a protocol for the situation.
D’oh! Just realized I’ll be flying home on @SouthwestAir during #StoryDam Writing Chat! (I’ll be able to lead it next week, though.)
@SouthwestAir Update the policy. It's not about number of people it's about those who qualify. 7 and 10 year old kids do not necessitate priority boarding.
@SouthwestAir so much for checking in on time...family boarding is ridiculous over the holidays when the only people traveling are FAMILIES! Let's just have 35 people cut the line because they gave birth at one point in time. #fareisfair get it?
@SouthwestAir We don't currently have travel plans but I guess we'll have to throw something together. Shucks! Well thank you Sarah for the prompt and helpful response, and please put me down as "not a fan of this policy".
@SouthwestAir Thank you but in order to become number one, you have to be able to face challenges and overcome them starting with finding extra flights for Atlanta, Greenville, Charlotte, and Raleigh!!! 🤗
@SouthwestAir I have vouchers expiring mid-February but can't get away before March, if I book a flight later in the year, is that a valid form of payment as long as I redeem before the expiration date, or does the flight have to be before the date on the voucher?
Nothing but respect for the dude who ordered a Miller Lite on a 50 minute 7 am @SouthwestAir flight
Ok, @SouthwestAir help four determined Clemson females out by adding some more return morning flights to Atlanta on January 14, please!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾
@SouthwestAir stop being full of shit tricking people
Mannn shoutout @SouthwestAir for these drink coupons!! #TMC 🏁🏁🏁
Could @SouthwestAir just ONCE have my bags out on time? I’ve been waiting 20 minutes....
@SouthwestAir your policy of no change/cancel/refund fees, is great for people who are trying to plan around unexpected events... like labor and delivery. My family appreciates it! #pregnancy #dadlife
Also- our gate agent, Joe, was one of the sweetest and attentive I have ever had. A lot of people waiting to board our flight murmured the same thing and he deserves to be recognized @SouthwestAir
Just a hunch that my favorite airline @SouthwestAir is having mega WiFi problems on the planes. 4 flights in the last 3 days and each one has been awful. Interestingly, only one flight attendant even acknowledged the problem. Hope it’s fixed soon guys.
@SouthwestAir I just wanted to shoutout to our FAs on flight 4174 from Denver to San Diego last night! They were fantastic. I know Southwest has a great reputation but those three exemplified that.
@SouthwestAir The airport staff opened the doors. Rushing to gate
@SouthwestAir Fire alarm pulled at SJC. How do I get to my terminal!? The doors between terminals are clieed
The longest minute in the history of time is that last 60 seconds before you can check into a @SouthwestAir flight. Amirite? ⏰😬 #gottagetAgroup
@SouthwestAir The flight crew was great. We love SW. Off to Hawaii end of the month. First flight with SW to Hawaii, so excited.
@SouthwestAir Can you send a DM?
@SouthwestAir Can I get some assistance
Not ready to leave home tomorrow, gonna miss the family. Anyway @SouthwestAir can hook me up with free wifi so I can text the fam and pretend I’m still home during my flight?
@SouthwestAir Thank you Sandy! I’m happy to be on board my favorite airline!
@SouthwestAir Thank You that really means a lot to me because 10 min before boarding I had an emotional breakdown cried uncontrollably the agents comforted me during my time of need and made sure I was ok thank you for the support during my time of need
@SouthwestAir To each their own. I certainly prefer the guarantee of sitting with my traveling partner rather than a free for all situation. Again thank you for your courteous responses 🙏
@SouthwestAir Today made my future decisions easier. #choices #iwillremember
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the response! What is the reasoning for having open seating? As someone who flys frequently I may avoid using southwest in the future if traveling with friends or family.
Completely blown away by the dismal failure of @SouthwestAir today. Wasted over $1,100 on flights just so that I could keep A-List status, only for them to tell me 🖕because their website and customer service folks misguided my steps through the process.
@SouthwestAir Always when I’m flying!! 📷 📷
@SouthwestAir pls don’t fuck up my bass since you guys had me check it in which has never happened. Thank you
@SouthwestAir In his field he is instructed to not fly in uniform.
@SouthwestAir He was very proud to say no.
@SouthwestAir flying on Southwest today has been an average flying experience. However, the fact that they don’t have assigned seats does not make sense. This must lead to daily squabbles amongst travelers being split up from the party they are traveling with. Why?
@SouthwestAir you won't let active duty military not board after A group without being in uniform?!!? Ever heard of opsec? #Military
Very frustrated and disappointed with @SouthwestAir. Weeks ago I inquired about an issue with my rapid rewards account not linking with my Chase CC. Still no resolution, I call today and they have no record of my call. This is complete bullshit.
@SouthwestAir After being a loyal A list member at Southwest, taking over 2 flights a month for almost 4 years Southwest corporate has managed in one day to make me never want to fly Southwest again. No loyalty to their customers
Wonder if @SouthwestAir can help me out with wedding travel plans!
Everything has a funny way of working out. I’m so grateful that @SouthwestAir flies to all the cities I’m planning on visiting in May out on the West coast! San Diego, San Fran, LA, Salt Lake City, and Portland, here I come! ✈️ #businesstravel #ptotravel
What an amazing day when @SouthwestAir keeps delaying your flight. Lovely way to start a year 😠😠😠 #4hoursdelay #youcandobettersouthwest
@SouthwestAir thank you for being so awesome and switching my flight for me! #blondemoment #holidayseason #iloveswa
@SouthwestAir I'm sorry I never saw this - thanks to flight 2420 Aug 14 - long ago but very appreciated - I hope you will pass along my thanks again - SWA's Ms Lara Campbell, I think
@SouthwestAir Nice views as long ad it's not on a 737 max
@SouthwestAir Always!!!!! Coach Hall and the Central Ohio Cyclones Love Southwest!!!
@SouthwestAir Gate agent for flight 2995 from ATL to LaGuardia is awesome! Early morning and she made me smile. #thanks
@SouthwestAir We we’re returning home on Monday, December 30th. Originally scheduled RDU-BWI-PWM. Due to a snowstorm BWI-PWM was cancelled. Please recognize the gate agent who rebooked us to BOS with minutes to spare. She was awesome! ❄️✈️❄️
@SouthwestAir Thx for response. Yes, please look into this as it simply doesn’t make sense. It doesn’t cost anything and is an easy fix. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir Thank you Amanda!! We are all so excited!! ❤💍💍🛫🛫✈✈🛩🛩
@SouthwestAir Thank you Alyssa, courtesy and patience goes a long way! New year new attitude
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Just hoping to spread the word. Curbside took maybe 5 minutes. Lightning quick. Hang in there on this busy morning!
@SouthwestAir flight 609 gate agent really need to work on a New Years resolution of not being so rude to customers. Total B to the whole flight
Holy cow! @SouthwestAir tells me suitcase is lost, before we board. 8 hrs later, it’s at our final destination with “rush” tags on it. My kids, husband &amp; I were thrilled!!! I was filing a report with baggage claim when it came! THANK YOU SO MUCH! 🙏
@SouthwestAir Hi. I just sent a direct message.
@SouthwestAir You guys fucking suck. Probably the shittiest airline out here.
@SouthwestAir I didn’t know that was something you could do and was trying to get home after a long travel day. Is there something I can fill out online or over the phone?
@SouthwestAir Will send the message shortly
@SouthwestAir we are highly upset that We am having to call off of work today because we didn’t find out till we were sitting at our gate that our flight was cancelled. 😡😡
This is the 2nd trip in a row that I’ve had one of @SouthwestAir’s baggage people break the wheels on my suitcase. Y’all should be buying me new luggage.
@SouthwestAir meanwhile we have been sitting on the ground for 20 minutes waiting to taxi to the gate.
@SouthwestAir just curious, do you guys purposely break your planes AC and give bags of ice to people in a 90° plane. Or am I special??
Flight 6099 @SouthwestAir-my first flight of the year and the flight was delayed and the attendants were beyond rude. SW you need to align on training regarding ESAs. It feels oppressive when arbitrary rules are randomly “enforced” when it comes to my ESA. I’m disappointed.
@SouthwestAir No - they were closed
Thank you @SouthwestAir for a safe flight ✈✈✈
@SouthwestAir needs to get their act together. Wet bags, delays, and now they told me my bag is in another state. Had all my Christmas presents for tonight, can’t change clothes after ten hours of travel, now delayed so I have to book a hotel. Costing me a lot of time and money.
@SouthwestAir Flying back to Salt Lake City on February 13 so getting some nice pics of the snow covered mountains from above shouldn't be a problem
@SouthwestAir flown 4 planes directly over me in the past 5 minutes, and over 40 today, many at less than 3000 ft. That is just the ones I registered complaints &amp; was home to hear. They are assaulting us. Making us ill. 15 years in home no planes. They claim nothing has changed
@SouthwestAir this is NOT the way I wanted to start my 2020!
@SouthwestAir as it relates to flight 4776 MSY to LAX : Can you tell me why my bags are in Dallas and I’m in Los Ángeles? I didn’t have any connecting flights. Straight flight from NOLA TO LAX. Now, I’m experiencing a huge inconvenience as both checked bags are not with me!
My first time flying @SouthwestAir was today.. Omg the flight today was so relaxing. Bags were checked properly. Customer service was a 10+ &amp; 5star! Plane was delayed but the pilot accommodated. Thank you ☺️ #NewYearDayTravelers
@SouthwestAir Credit card not processing and my cards are good. Transaction fails. I booked with mirage direct and would of liked the 1000 swa points since it didn’t work
@SouthwestAir Communication extremely lacking &amp; ridiculous inconvenience. Haul thru long custom lines, across 3 terminals, wait in lines to check in again w/no SWA employee to clarify what is going on. Started at 2pm CST, now MAYBE getting to final OAK destination by 11:30pm PST. 5 hs later.
Dear @SouthwestAir, I apologize for going with a cheaper, lesser quality airline this holiday season. I feel that I have cheated on the one who has been so good to me over the years. I miss you, boo. It'll never happen again. Sincerely, Spencer
@SouthwestAir - I forgot the flight attendant’s name for Flight 6318 but he’s hilarious! Thanks for a smooth sailing flight. Until next time ✈️ ✌️♥️ #LoveSouthwest
I’m almost convinced that @SouthwestAir doesn’t want their customers to be happy 🙃
LOL landed at 9:35 and still not at a gate. Yes this is probably my last time flying @SouthwestAir.
@SouthwestAir really need to get a hold of the oversized bag situation at LAX. Kinda crazy. Switched back to SWA from AA but wasnt expecting this!
@SouthwestAir thanks for getting me to and from my holiday destinations with NO delays this year. It made the season a little brighter.
So I’m on my flight which was scheduled to leave on time. Everyone is on the plane and ready to leave. We are still at the gate. Why? Well because some employees wanted to get on this flight and paperwork had to be done. We are now delayed 30 minutes @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Yes, please! Can't wait for our next flight with you next month. Also, our first time to Hawaii with SWA in April :D
@SouthwestAir Yes I did as I was trying to track down the 8 bags that did not make the flight, I will speak with them further as I have to go back to DEN tomorrow to pick them up.
@SouthwestAir Southwest gave me wrong information to begin with. And then the Very Best y’all can do to make up for it is “hey sorry one of our employees gave you wrong information but there’s nothing we can do to fix it” I’m not asking for a favor, I’m asking that you do the right thing!
@SouthwestAir not to be that guy but I have your credit card and am a rewards member and spend all this $$$$ on you and you have never given me a single drink ticket. Why??? I love you but you keep burning me lately
@SouthwestAir Got a flight in 3 weeks! Love these views!
@SouthwestAir your website is down for hotels
@SouthwestAir 1+ hour wait for bags in Sky Harbor. What’s the deal?
@SouthwestAir flight 1872. Now a plane swap out of Vegas. You guys are killing me. #dobetterSWA
@SouthwestAir flight 1872 LAS to BUR. Delayed one hour before we get on the plane. Get boarded and pilot says he is finishing up maint. paperwork and we will leave soon. After 10 min he says there is maint issue and it will be an hour. Ridiculous. #dobetterSWA
Welp, what ya know? Another delayed flight @SouthwestAir #NewYearSameSouthwest
Thanks @SouthwestAir for making my 11-year old daughters first flight solo a smooth one. ☺️ #vacationmodeon
@SouthwestAir please help! Left my phone at C24 in Denver!! You guys found it. #SouthwestAirlines
@SouthwestAir I left my cell phone in Denver at Gate c24. You guys found it. Can someone help send it back to me?
First time I have been on an over hour and half @SouthwestAir flight that didn’t offer drink service. Not even very much turbulence. I guess they wanted today off as well.
@SouthwestAir I've noticed I don't see flights that are non-stop to Detroit. I fly there almost every month to see my 92 year old father and now I can't fly non-stop?? What the heck??
@SouthwestAir Thanks. Y’all are the best!
Lol boarded B41 on @SouthwestAir and got first row window seat Happy New Years 😏
@SouthwestAir My flight cannot come any sooner! Next week! 🤩
@SouthwestAir what is your policy for travelers with mechanical delays? In DEN on flight 6273 to Indy now delayed 3 hrs. Thank you! Happy new year.
I keep hearing how @SouthwestAir mails out drink vouchers to people with Rapid Rewards or their credit card. I have both and have never gotten anything (I’ve flown them exclusively for about six years). Am I missing something?!
Hey, @SouthwestAir, please don’t recommend arriving two hours before your flight is scheduled to depart then delay the flight 3 hours. Kinda crummy way to spend first day of 2020. At least let passengers know what is going on every hour.
@SouthwestAir Thanks! I will DM my complaint letter with details of my booking and what happened.
@SouthwestAir OK thanks. As long as there will be no issues w/TSA, we are good!
@SouthwestAir thanks for gettin me to and from a bunch of totally rad destinations last decade. lookin forward to more this decade!
@SouthwestAir I have no doubt the folks on the ground are doing their best. It's the folks at Corporate who write the schedules and set the budgets who I imagine are at fault. This is a systemic, repeated, and predictable failure. That's not caused by a baggage handler.
@SouthwestAir That is exactly what I was asking for, to which the gate agent said “big dogs only”. Very disappointed :( Generally unpleasant trip with every other Southwest staff questioning whether my dog was an ESA even though it’s printed on my boarding pass.
@SouthwestAir I'm having problems redeeming a promotional points code, error says it failed to validate claim code after inputting codes and account details. What should I do?
@SouthwestAir does the maximum check in baggage size of 62” include the wheels?
For how much @SouthwestAir prides itself on its turn, it sure does take a long time for bags to reach the carousel.
@SouthwestAir I read online New Year's Day is a holiday you offer drinks.
@SouthwestAir completely unsatisfied flyer... I’m not confident I will be choosing southwest in the future. Break a bag going into Chicago, lose two bags coming back. Long line of flyers that lost luggage and you blame “late check-in”. Rude attendant, just walked away...
@SouthwestAir whatsup with no free drink on my flight today? Is that something you don't do anymore on holidays?
@SouthwestAir I would like to speak to the manger at your Customer Relations center. If necessary please connect me to your executive office.
@SouthwestAir Jeni, I trusted Southwest Airline in the past. That was why I booked our vacation package on Southwest Airline Vacation. Though the issues are caused by your partner, this is still a issue of Southwest Airline. You need to fix it!
@SouthwestAir Austin, Southwest might not “inventory” baggage as a company but someone who handled the baggage did, and they relieved it of some inventory. How do I write an email to customer service, please? Your response is insufficient.
@SouthwestAir Thank you. SWA is usually amazing. I get that this time of year is challenging &amp; I was frustrated but she did nothing to help the situation &amp; then just completely cut me off. Thank you
As 2020 began I was flying into Atlanta, and at midnight the crew darkened the cabin lights, wished us a happy new year, and urged us to look out over the city at all the fireworks blooming above backyards. @SouthwestAir we really enjoyed the moment that crew gave us -- thanks!
@SouthwestAir why is flight 4279 atl to ind delayed??
well, my post vacation depression has officially hit AGAIN. round 2 at the airport @SouthwestAir please don’t cancel this flight again
@SouthwestAir is there a reason we are all waiting 30min+ after are arrival for our bags?? Asking for everyone that came from Kansas, Houston, and Chicago??
I have flown at least once per month every month since August. I think every single @SouthwestAir connection has been delayed. The less expensive fare only makes sense if the schedule is kept. This 2 hours wasted in St Louis tonight is the last 2 hours I will waste. Enough!
@SouthwestAir With travels during the holiday season, I missed the notification of a flight change and therefore missed the window to change or cancel without penalty. Is it too late to cancel? The time change does not work for us.
@SouthwestAir please come back to Jackson. Miss you.
@SouthwestAir can a garment bag be used as a carry on?
@SouthwestAir Your customer service is so amazing. I wish the agent I just talked to, Leah (sp?!), could join us on our next vacay. Life is better because people are awesome.
Big thx to Ivan @SouthwestAir San Diego baggage claim for finding my lost wallet on my BWI - SAN flight today. Guess I had one too many glasses of red wine. 😱
I love @SouthwestAir let’s make that clear tho lol
@SouthwestAir Delays are a part of travel, poor communication with your customers is not. Have a good evening.
@SouthwestAir Disappointing to learn that free drinks are no longer served on Holidays. When did this change? Flight #4652 Customers not happy...
@SouthwestAir you can have your vouchers back...first co-pilot “loses” his sheet to show his available time to fly and we’re told 4 hour delay in Cancun. Then you load plane 2 hours later and no annoucment (almost missed flight) and we lost our A1 and A47 spots. Continued...
@SouthwestAir just opened suitcase after traveling on SW flight 5814 and pillow that had been placed on top is gone! No TSA flyer stating bag had been searched. Can’t find on SW website how to handle this. And it was a nice pillow!
Travel day from hell. 2.5 hr delay waiting for flight to arrive and now that it is here what was direct to OAK is stopping in LAX to change crew? Not my fault. A-List usual SWA traveler but what the heck. Delay compensation please! @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir And regrettably your subpar CLE service (both unloading and the office) is to blame as the pool of alcohol outside the office was the entire bottle and it was in HARDside luggage.
@SouthwestAir Also she was super condescending and said “how would YOU feel if you had paid $700 for a first class ticket?!?” Excuse me a simple no would’ve sufficed 😒
@SouthwestAir What the heck????? Our flight is here but not we have to stop in LAX to change crew when it was a direct flight to OAK? Not my fault. Delay compensation please!
@SouthwestAir Can this be DM'd? I do not want my information public
@SouthwestAir for military not on orders, how many bags can I check for free besides the two?
The past 8 Southwest flights I’ve been on have been delayed. @SouthwestAir y’all trash.
@SouthwestAir Actually, I was waaaay to angry to wait any longer to speak with anyone, but I did leave what I was left with in front of the Cutomer Service office. And despite the STRONG smell of liquor, the lady in the office was not concerned as she passed by at LEAST four times!
@SouthwestAir I have an ESA and every other airline will accommodate early boarding because I need extra time. The gate agent just said they will only let “big dogs” preboard, I’m very disappointed. Not only that, my bf and I checked in with one click and he’s in B but I’m in C?!
@SouthwestAir Please respond to my DM about the three cancelled flights I had to deal with this week!
I do not expect to have as many flights in 2020, but I want to explore more new countries. Tahiti is booked for July &amp; planning Finland and Estonia for April. I would also like to get to Kona &amp; Lihue on @SouthwestAir and maybe Turks and Caicos.
@SouthwestAir stuck on ground after landing in Little Rock for over 30 minutes now... come on man!
@SouthwestAir And it will be departing tonight and not on the 2nd?
6 flights coming into Austin on 1 baggage claim carousel when 3 others right next to it were open. Our flight disappeared on the screen after waiting 20 min. Asked baggage claim woman what was going on. RUDEST EMPLOYEE I have ever dealt with @SouthwestAir Rudest!
@SouthwestAir very delayed flight #125 from PV to Oak your communication sucks on what, when &amp; where the plane will be going to eventually get us back to Oakland. Not the experience I want to start off 2020 w/Southwest! Was barely holding on staying with you. 2019=70+ flights!
@SouthwestAir Sitting in LR airport and cannot get off this Southwest Flight 6220because we did not have a Marshall to park us or someone to drive the jetway truck. 40 minutes now??WTF?
@SouthwestAir. Flight 6220 landed 15 minutes early but 35 minutes later they are still on the plane! #whatgives #stuckonaplane
Yikes. Wisconsin punter now the new face of the "Wanna Get Away?" @SouthwestAir commercials. #RoseBowl
@SouthwestAir I’m on a flight sitting next to a lady with a dog! This dog is barking and yelping the entire flight! Come on! This is ridiculous!! They have a right to being done. She is freaking holding the dog
@SouthwestAir So, I should buy 1 priority instead of 4 because your employees won’t do their job ?
@SouthwestAir And now they randomly want to double check my passport because someone has a “name” like mine? Child please.
@SouthwestAir hi i have conflicting delay times that were texted to me vs. what was listed on the website; can you clarify as to when flight 4201 from midway will depart?
@SouthwestAir And why do I pay $100 for priority boarding when families “save” rows doe people still in line?
@SouthwestAir hi! I’m traveling in a few days and I am bringing an emotional support cat with me. Can you add her to my reservation?
UPDATE: I threw up the entire flight and we had the worst turbulence I’ve ever experienced and now it’s been 45 minutes since we’ve landed and our bags still aren’t out and @SouthwestAir is saying this is normal. Beezy I’ve been using sac airport for years this ain’t normal!!
@SouthwestAir I never used social media to complain about anything before. This is the 1st time when SouthWest Airline Vacation failed to fix over $500 wrongful charge on our credit card due to a booking error caused by the on-line booking system of Southwest Airline Vacation.

Why don’t airlines check the mechanics of planes before boarding passengers? I understand that things break, but why board, only to have to de-board due to a mechanical issue? @SouthwestAir I love you forever I’m not mad at you, just a question.
@SouthwestAir hi LUV. I’m on 4074 tonight. Is it a plane change in MSY or same plane. Trying to decide if I get dinner now or in MSY. TY!
@SouthwestAir OMG I have a travel voucher that I am trying to use for Vegas-- cancelled a flight to Nashville in September -- trying to use that voucher for April today and it is saying it is void??
Boarded @SouthwestAir flight and military men &amp; women were boarding early. They didnt let two in line because they werent “in uniform” Had ID and clearly with the group. I asked the ticket guy if that was a real thing &amp; he told me if I didnt like it take it up with SW. #HereYaGo
@SouthwestAir I fly 30+ flights a year. I see this everywhere. These people DID NOT need assistance and even the gate gentleman from SWA agreed. Charge them more and it will stop. I agree people generally need preboard, and the woman in the wheelchair had to wait for these scammers.
@SouthwestAir so I know it’s a short flight and your pilot said safety concerns but to start a flight hearing it’s not a good day to fly because it’s so bumpy there will be no service and no one allowed to use the restroom for the duration is not comforting at all.
@SouthwestAir Unfortunately there are no other flights to change to so I am stuck and inconvenienced to just wait ....... and get notifications of delays
@SouthwestAir stuck in PVR due to flight delayed to arrive from SJD cuz of rain. Leaving now at least 2.5 hours later and will miss the window to have dinner with my son back home. Frustrated. Still not sure when exactly the plane will come.
@SouthwestAir Stuck in Cancun. First Officer lost his ID and can’t fly. 5 hour delay and a $14 voucher for food. Is it true we’ll get out tonight?
@SouthwestAir can’t tell if my tweet went. I’m on a southwest flight. Do we get free drinks 🍷 today
@SouthwestAir do we get free drinks on New Year’s Day on all flights
Starting the New Year stuck on a plane w a 30 min delay so far and no ETA for departure with 2 kids under 7. @SouthwestAir thaaaaaanks
@SouthwestAir Landed in Denver and you guys did a little better with bags.. 1st bag coming out 35 minutes after landing. It’s not the desired 20, but I can live with that. Problem is with my oversized bag, I’ll be here an hour in the end.. better though!
5 hour delay because @SouthwestAir pilot can’t find his ID. Great start to the new year.
@SouthwestAir kudos to Brandon White at curb side. Great customer service from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta
@SouthwestAir SWA 3213 is stuck in Cancun as the first mate lost his ID... Is there anything you can do?????
@SouthwestAir the gate agent just announced it less than 10 minutes ago. dm'd
@SouthwestAir 5 hour delay because your pilot doesn’t have an ID?
@SouthwestAir My email is Justin dot eisele at seddiqlaw dot com if you would like to set up a discussion with a loyal customer.
@SouthwestAir First Officer lost his ID so we can’t fly back from Mexico. Flt 3213. Why can’t Southwest fix this?
@SouthwestAir Need you guys to get back to do the SNA to SJD nonstop. Anything less is a bad 2020.
@SouthwestAir first officer umm... forgot his id, so he can't fly wn3213, delaying the flight at least 4 hours. how on earth does this happen?
I think @SouthwestAir gives lots of people the same group position of like “B21” bc it is always there that the straight line becomes 1 giant clump of flailing arms, waving tickets in each other’s faces #southwest #fly #boarding
Shoutout to @SouthwestAir for not charging up the butt for last minute flight changes. You're my hero rn
@SouthwestAir Can I get a free flight? 😍
@SouthwestAir omgg whatt two bags free im elated (if only you had flights to toronto :( i would be your top passenger!) Looking forward to flying and I'll keep you posted :D
@SouthwestAir Yay!! Okay another question - do I get 2 free checked-in baggage? Im travelling domestically and was wondering (first time with you)
We rang in the new year on @SouthwestAir flight 3791 from LAS to BHM, and service was absolutely excellent. Pilots &amp; attendants made jokes, were joyful, and helped us ring in a new year at 37,000 feet. A great experience for the New Year.
@SouthwestAir heyaa do you serve food on flight or is there an option to buy?
@SouthwestAir Oh, yeah, and I got kicked from A59 boarding to C19. I should be landing now and havent boarded yet. Don't tell me to DM you when you dont respond to a DM. Geez
@SouthwestAir I didn’t I got want to get away and the other flight isnt even full and I can’t get on it without paying double my original ticket 😩. This policy feels oppressive
@SouthwestAir One of the essential benefits of the Rapid Rewards program is (was) a dedicated line for your most loyal customers. The lack of the FlyBy lane greatly reduces the value of A+ Preferred.
@SouthwestAir I am not a complainer. This pre board non-protocol is completely out of hand If you have a policy enforce it!!!
@SouthwestAir No kiosk bag check at CVG. Pretty wildly inconvenient.
I called @SouthwestAir to book a flight (I was having problems with the app) and I was told my hold time was 7 minutes. Well over 25 minutes go by and by the time I reach a representative one way increased and the flight back home sold out. UGH
@SouthwestAir Will be looking for it On my trip to New Orleans Sunday for the playoffs :-)
@SouthwestAir Hopefully to SJC and PHL. How about more destinations in Pa.
@SouthwestAir Do I still have my points from last year 👀
RIP my @SouthwestAir #CompanionPass #AListPreferred statuses. #2020NewYear
@SouthwestAir Actually Burbank would be better, lax is the worst
@SouthwestAir I'm a member MOBS-Moms of Bragg Soldiers. 4,000 soldiers of the 82nd Airborne have been called up to deploy to Iraq. Many were home on Holiday Leave. Ordered back to base...I heard SW was charging to change flights. I'm disappointed in you!
@SouthwestAir Chicago in April #excited #AvGeek
@SouthwestAir Already looking at the calendar! 😍✈️
@SouthwestAir Excited to take the fam to Hawaii this year
@SouthwestAir Hopefully it will happen soon ☺️
I have yet to hear back from @SouthwestAir since the last 600 interactions, but maybe after the next 600, I will!
@SouthwestAir ME! I’m about to book two trips and then maybe a few more 😜
@SouthwestAir Do they have to be wearing their uniform when they are boarding?
@SouthwestAir 145 flights in the last two years. See you again in a few days...
@SouthwestAir Why don’t y’all fly to Miami 😔
@SouthwestAir can I bring my dog on a flight?
@SouthwestAir Instead of offering connecting service to Hawaii from la, why not do direct?
@SouthwestAir I earned my #companionpass on the final day of 2019. See you again soon.
@SouthwestAir NO EXCUSE that we have been sitting on the tarmac in Houston waiting for a gate for over 30 min! How about moving to one of the open gates!!!
@SouthwestAir Had a 2 week break. Will be back in the air next week with 3 SWA flights. Got to keep my 5 yr A-List streak going! #HappyNewYears
@SouthwestAir For a moment I thought you said something about GrindR 😉
@SouthwestAir I prefer the forward looking window on the flight deck 😁
@SouthwestAir Hoping to get my preferred this year!
@SouthwestAir Military Active Duty can no longer board between A and B Group unless you are in uniform. That’s crazy not every active duty member on orders travel in uniform.
@SouthwestAir customer service is the absolute best and a lifesaver
@SouthwestAir or is there like a change fee? I’d really love to be on an earlier flight 😩
@SouthwestAir just booked a flight using my maiden name instead of my current legally changed name. What can I do? Travel fund are under maiden name. Thank you!
If I show up at the airport early, can I fly standby @SouthwestAir
A pleasant surprise and start to 2020: I made @SouthwestAir A List tier! No better testament to how busy 2019 was 😅
@SouthwestAir You gave me no way to obtain boarding passes after I checked in for my flight online. This is a first for any airline I've flown.
@SouthwestAir Doesn’t list the holidays here.
@SouthwestAir Nope! If I wait a few days, I should then be able to add it, correct?
@SouthwestAir It doesn’t make any sense to try and book any travel with your app, then. If I have gift cards, I either must carry them with me in order to book on your app or I must sit at a computer to do it. Where can we go to vote on app enhancements?
@SouthwestAir is the only 100% quality airline
@SouthwestAir is it true that you only serve free drinks on valentine’s day in 2020?
@SouthwestAir Why have the policy if it is not followed?
Big thank you to Lala, superstar flight attendant on @SouthwestAir for a great flight the other day!
Hey @SouthwestAir, question! Booked two flights when I was A-list but flying after status didn’t review. Tried to add early bird today, says flight isn’t eligible still? What’s going on?
@SouthwestAir when are we going to be able to store gift cards in the iOS app?
Travel tips of the day from the @SouthwestAir check-in desk: Southwest charges $75 for bags over 50 pounds, but they'll sell you a tote bag for $25 (in Austin at least). Jeans weigh 2 pounds. Bag of coffee weighs 2 pounds.
@SouthwestAir uhhh help. I had 29,445 points in my account. Now that I logged in it’s all gone...
i love @SouthwestAir and have been a loyal customer for years, but the TSA assigned to their gates at san diego suck 🤭
@SouthwestAir I have an umbrella that won't fit in my suitcase. Can I carry it on my flight?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for patronizing. Happy New Year.
Edit* purple hard case Calvin Klein suitcase are OKC @SouthwestAir
Someone please tell me @SouthwestAir is EXCELLENT about retrieving lost luggage! 🙏🙏🙏😩😩😩
clarification: its alexlayden on Venmo and wife has granted permission pending @SouthwestAir reinstating the companion pass let’s go to ‘The Gator Bowl’
@SouthwestAir Thanks. Read your policy. I get the Disabilities part and the requirements. Unfortunately, this separation and reseating does not solve the allergic reaction issue. Hmmmmmm
@SouthwestAir we haven’t even boarded our flight. The luggage people threw my suitcase on the carousel WITHOUT tagging it checking in. So we haven’t even started flying &amp; have already been told our luggage is lost!!!! 😩😩😩😩😖😖😖😖. Valuables!!!!! 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
.@SouthwestAir i thought i had companion pass for a year plus the next year what the hell we’re trying to go to The Gator Bowl
@SouthwestAir y’all lost my bag with all of my clothes and Christmas presents for a week and now I’m being told I can’t get a voucher because I didn’t come pick it up myself and y’all don’t have managers????????????????????????????????????
@SouthwestAir I get that, but it would have been great to get more of a heads up so we could have a better contingency plan, versus going straight from "on time" to "cancelled" 30 mins before boarding.
@SouthwestAir I already posted my questions.... so.... maybe respond to those publicly. Inam sure I am not the only one with questions. Ty.
@SouthwestAir what is going on with Flight 6254 from DEN to DAL? It’s not even noon and the 3pm departure has been delayed twice. Please let us know.
Hi 👋 @SouthwestAir HNY! Hey, I applaud you for allowing service and emotional support animals on your flights. I love animals. I also am very allergic to cats - it’s the dander and it’a airborne. I have had a hard time with pets in planes lately... so....my questions:
How to get drink vouchers for my trip in 2 weeks, lol. 🤔 @SouthwestAir
People who don’t drink cover such a wide swath of the American public, so it really would be in line with the @SouthwestAir hospitality-focused brand to jump in on this.
My biggest failure of 2019 was not using the drink coupons that @SouthwestAir sent me.
Southwest Airlines @SouthwestAir SWA4887 is #WheelsDown on KMDW runway 22L. Another great flight, now to go take care of 🏀 business.
@SouthwestAir No disappointment here at all. Just always curious about technical innovations :-) thanks for the coups
@SouthwestAir What are you talking about? They should have to check in at the same time as everyone else.
Happy New Year #southwest @SouthwestAir another year of loving you!
The “family boarding” between A and B on @SouthwestAir is a bunch of bullshit.
Shout out to @SouthwestAir for being super shitty with terrible customer service! Way to go guys! You did it!
On top of that, I didn’t know @SouthwestAir flight attendants are okay with their guests saving seats, 6 people! &amp; rejecting people to sit next to them just because “they don’t want you to sit next to them” a couple said “no sorry you can’t sit here” and attendants did nothing.
@SouthwestAir just a little feedback on your flight attendant Vincent on flight 4165 for berating a mother of 4 when she hurried to use the restroom on her multi flight home on New Years day. I am beyond upset by his ridicule.
@SouthwestAir been an Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred or A-List member since Southwest changed their boarding to the numbering system. Now I missed my 2019 A-List renewal by one flight and lost all my status. Sorry, this is sad. Looks like I will be flying another airline.
Never flying @SouthwestAir again. I don’t demand respect because I’m in the military now, but they don’t respect their military in the slightest way. If your telemarking, and two different airports are saying different things about your policies. There’s a problem.
@SouthwestAir It’s 2020 now. Let’s get those customer loyalty programs, aka drink coupons, added to the app. 🤯
I thought bright and sunny weather all the way from Wmass to SD would make for a smooth trip, nope! @SouthwestAir captains chair needs to be repaired so the flight is delayed. Plane flew here just fine though, let’s get on with it.
@SouthwestAir I have a voucher that expires 1/17 but will be traveling 2/5-2/8...can you please help me extend it? 🤞
The stares you get while flying with an infant on @SouthwestAir with an open seat next to you.
I love @SouthwestAir hospitality. Everyone is always so nice.
I’ll double down. Lots of great suggestions in the replies @SouthwestAir. I’ll pay for my own ticket, on your airlines, to your headquarters, to discuss with your leadership.
@SouthwestAir I got a ticket for my friend and she will not b using it. It has been less than 24 hrs so I can get a refund if I cancel? Happy New Year.
First time traveling with @SouthwestAir: First flight: perfect. Second flight: flight attendants show up 8 minutes after boarding was supposed to start. 🧐
@SouthwestAir I was not! Is there a way to do that online?
@SouthwestAir Yes! I paid with a credit card so if I need to cancel in a couple of months, I'll be expecting a refund to the card!
@SouthwestAir I’ll believe it when I see it lol. Hoping for the best
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the reply! Would the taxes/fees be refunded as well? To the original form of payment?
Some very big 6 year olds in the family boarding group @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Are points booking for fare "Wanna Get Away" refundable or nonrefundable?
All Baylor fans @SouthwestAir flight 2123 from Houston this morning. Sicem Bears!! #BaylorFamily #SugarBowl #SicEm
@SouthwestAir Just DMd you. Thank you.
Extremely perturbed @SouthwestAir employee Janet at the Omaha airport. She would not help to get me a gate pass to go and sit with my minor children while they waited on their flight to see their dad. Had to involve a supervisor. I’ve NEVER had an issue getting a gate pass!
Once again, @SouthwestAir made our holiday travel smooth and painless. Pretty stellar flight crew with James on flight 3894 DTW &gt; PHX. Thank you! #weflysouthwest #kidsareamused
I guess @SouthwestAir is hungover too from NYE, they cancelled my flight this morning an hour before takeoff 😭 we not young anymore
JFC @SouthwestAir. How do you lose a bag on a non-stop? Did you throw it out the window on the way to Austin?
Southwest Airlines @SouthwestAir SWA4346 is #WheelsDown on KCLE runway 24R. Thank you for the great flight.
@SouthwestAir Okay but Tiffany. Y’all need a new system that doesn’t punish people for y’all delaying flights. I know it’s not your fault but you’re all I have!! There must be a widdle upgwade avawable ❤️
Quick trip to Cali to drop off my step daughters with @SouthwestAir My flight back to Denver lands after 1 am. Happy New Year everyone.
@SouthwestAir got my first drink coupon set in the mail - when are these going to be available to save on the wallet app on iPhone so I don’t have to carry around tiny slivers of paper??
@SouthwestAir Why are the only options to fly from LGB-MSY thru NoCA &amp; pricey? You already fly thru HOU LAS PHX etc. Pls fix route options &amp; price. Thx!😃
Irony is: - The @SouthwestAir flight attendants don't like my jokes this morning. Ohhhhh.... I see how it is 😝
... @SouthwestAir has changed my fight status 3 times in the past 20 minutes what is happening y’all
Just booked my flight with @SouthwestAir for April. Starting off 2020 the right way! Hoping that this would be my last trip visiting my boyfriend because we have a goal for summer of 2020 to finally live together. But glad that Southwest made the long distance bearable.
@SouthwestAir Thanks! If only that GIF came with bonus points 😉
Southwest Airlines @SouthwestAir flight SWA4346 N442WN is #WheelsUp from KATL runway 26L to KCLE.
A little Happy New Year gift to me from @SouthwestAir - a 4:55am text message that my 9:55am flight is cancelled. Not delayed. Cancelled.
@SouthwestAir Yes I made a report. But haven't heard anything since
@SouthwestAir can I just say the crew on flight 6231 made for the perfect New Year’s Eve date? They were so festive and it was so magical to watch the fireworks as we landed. I can’t think of a better way to kick in the new year 💙❤️💛
@SouthwestAir Now we're being told it's because of luggage... seems fishy. But the captain and stewardess are just bs'in at the front of the plane... why doesn't this happen on other airlines I fly?
why didn’t i get any @SouthwestAir free drink coupons for my birthday ?
Anyone in Chicago have flight cancellation issues yesterday? My @SouthwestAir flight (Midway-&gt;Oakland, 6:20am) got cancelled yesterday, wondering if it was just my flight or more. At the airport now and🤞this one doesn’t get cancelled.
Super disappointed in @SouthwestAir been waiting for AN HOUR at Cleveland with not a single representative to check us in when my flight leaves in an hour and I still have to go through security👎🏼
I know my bag is heavy but we bout to see who at the check-in desk @SouthwestAir .
@SouthwestAir Mahalo Amanda, Happy New Year!
@SouthwestAir seriously southwest landed on flight 5159 Las-MDW. 30+ minutes and still no bags? Why?
@SouthwestAir normally I love you, but my flight landed 40 minutes ago and my entire flight's bags still haven't arrived at baggage claim. Dudes I just want to go home
Happy new years to my favorite airline!!! @SouthwestAir
Thanks to @SouthwestAir for great flights to Denver and back to Houston over the last 7 days. Great service and smooth flights!
@SouthwestAir I am upset, I never received my Kama’aina pts...what’s up with that?!?
@SouthwestAir Thank you for one last safe 2019 arrival home. There is something special about ringing in the new year with other fellow passengers as our airplane gracefully glides above the many fireworks &amp; celebrations below. #NashvilleNYE #Nashville #Tennessee #TwentyTwenty
@SouthwestAir Thank you. I sent my email.
@SouthwestAir Its disappointing that you have a cut off date for buying points and customers like don't event come to know about it until we make a call to southwest.
@SouthwestAir I just called southwest and found out that the website for purchasing points to qualify for the companion pass has closed. This is our first experience getting RR enough to qualify for the companion pass. Would really appreciate if you can consider us buyingpoints
@SouthwestAir, just landed at 12:30 a.m. New Year’s Day. I truly thought the airline with the sense of humor would have offered a free drink for those of us stuck in the air on NYE. You disappointed!
Happy New Year from the sky somewhere over the eastern seaboard on a @SouthwestAir flight to Baltimore! 🍾 🎉
@SouthwestAir If two people are on a reservation for a round trip flight and one person can’t make the 1st leg, do they get bumped from the return flight or can they both still take it?
@SouthwestAir thanks for ruining my day
#avgeek bat signal! My friend is a pilot for @SouthwestAir. It's his birthday and all the passengers sang happy birthday to him. Flying PHX-SJC, Southwest 6782. I know at least one of the 143 passengers recorded it and I need the video please. Haaalp
fuck you @SouthwestAir pulling some shit like changing the boarding gate on your flight with little time left before the flight causing my S/O to miss their flight home ON NEW YEARS EVE. THANKS
@SouthwestAir it wouldn't apply the credit to her part of rebooked trip. Additionally the credit couldn't be applied towards the early boarding cost. Long story short was only able to use $200 of the almost $500 credit. What is that about?
@SouthwestAir let them both know that they were a highlight in a crummy travel day and a truly great thing to carry into ringing in the new year!
@SouthwestAir I want to shout out two reps in the BSO office in ALB. Mary and Ilsa are so kind and kept their cool. I was part of a group impacted by weather out of MDW yesterday and I am so impressed by their professionalism in handling such a bananas situation. Please 1/2
So @SouthwestAir I can't tell you how dissatisfied I am with you. Purchased tickets for me and my girlfriend for a trip. Had to cancel so got a travel credit which had to be used in 1 year. Fine. Go to book another trip and because the credit was in my name it wouldn't apply
@SouthwestAir if I put skis in my bike bag, do I have to pay $75?
@SouthwestAir Hey could you make my new year by extending some expiring credits in Jan 2020
Hey @SouthwestAir if you automatically rebook passengers on later flight cuz missed connection due to 1st flight being delayed, maybe don’t assign C boarding when original flight was A boarding-4hr delay &amp; fam couldn’t sit together. #notcool
@SouthwestAir I’ve been gone from home every holiday please deliver me safe back to my family tomorrow! ✈️🤞🏾🧡
@SouthwestAir looking to book travel for March, with my travel fund that is expiring in 2 days.
Never flying with southwest again 2 straight flights have been delayed the second flight we weren’t even notified until 16 minutes after we were supposed to board @SouthwestAir
Thanks @SouthwestAir for the amazing baggage work. My flight mate was one of the first to get his bags but because mine was one of the last it would’ve been $50 for an Uber ride instead of $30
@SouthwestAir No gate, did you forget to tell them we were coming. Happy tarmac New Year!Flight 3312
@SouthwestAir Happy New Year, second flight in just over a month with NO WiFi/TV. Flight 3312, FLL-STL. Is this not having enough planes #737Maxproblem
@SouthwestAir - My elderly Mom on flight WN4878; DEN-NASH. The airport assistant pushing her wheelchair; stated I'll look after you, if you look after me. Puzzled, My mom said she asked her if she had anything for her? My mom told her No, she had no change.
@SouthwestAir We have been without our bags for 24+ hrs and can’t get anyone to tell us where they are.
@SouthwestAir can I buy a gift card in your app?
I just realized my flight for tomorrow is from the wrong city. Called up @SouthwestAir and they changed my flight to the correct city for free. I’m never flying another airline ever
@SouthwestAir I was flying yesterday with My wife &amp; kids 6, 4 &amp; 1. I had a preboard, surgery on foot. In msy they would not allow family to board with me. The attendant said we want the adult to go w/ you. He wanted my kids to board later by themselves. Are you kidding me?!
You Season 2: - Stellar @SouthwestAir shout-out. - Don’t root for the serial killer. Don’t root for the serial killer. - They eviscerate improv, kind of in the best way? (Still an unabashed improv fan.) - Dicks. Classic Hendy.
Always appreciate the service on @SouthwestAir but tonight we gotta give a special shoutout to Kevin on MDW to BWI flight. Our daughter was reading a science book for most of it, and he gave her a gigantic bag of pretzels for "being so smart." Whole crew was a NYE treat.
@SouthwestAir get it together. Been here wtg on my bags 45mins. Time is money. #6102
Just landed in chicago, been waiting 30 minutes now to exit the plane because @SouthwestAir is fixing a plane at the gate we are supposed to go to. Great job y'all
@SouthwestAir anything special for New Year’s Eve flyers like peanuts
UGH! Flight went from 8:20 to 8:45, 8:50, down to 8:30 when I tried to get the earlier flight, back to 8:45 after that flight boarded and still sitting waiting to board a 9:35 flight now. Happy New Year to me! Thanks @SouthwestAir ! If only you had let me get on that 6:40 flight.
@SouthwestAir Got us to Louisville early on NYE!! They Rock even if pilot is a UK fan. #4824
I landed at LaGuardia at 4:04PM and didn’t get my bag until 5:53PM. Get your shit together @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir aye I got a question
@SouthwestAir TUP846 Tell then thanks again!!
Guess I will be kissing the friendly skies at midnight rather than my Boo thanks @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Please bring back flights between Orlando and Flint! Stop making me fly Delta 😭
Shoutout to the crew on our @SouthwestAir flight this evening from PNS to BNA. My daughter lost a brand new 🍎 EarPod and they worked hard after everyone got off to find it. Thank y’all so much!!
@SouthwestAir thank you for the great flights we had today. You crew from Manyland to Dallas was excellent wham lady got sick on the land. One of the best crews and very professional . Thank for great flight
@SouthwestAir It was less the cancelation. That was, frankly, expected. December. Chicago. Post-sunset. It was more the SINGLE agent assisting us with re-booking. Like I said, I more or less expected the potential cancelation when I booked the flight, climate change and all....
“Welcome to our last flight of the day, the year, and the decade.” Can’t remember the last time I heard an entire ✈️ clap. Cheers, @SouthwestAir.
Maybe it’s the complimentary cocktails from @SouthwestAir but I couldn’t help myself from talking shit about Florida state immediately after seeing the opponent they lost to on the same flight. They didn’t appreciate it but man did I get a kick out of it lol ASU enjoyed it too
After flying @SouthwestAir 100x, ran into the rudest employee ever. The gate agent at MDW, gate A19 for flight #4723 to PHX would be immediately out of a job if I were her boss.
@SouthwestAir Yes we have but so far no luck of actually knowing the location of my girlfriend and I’s luggage unfortunately
Now @SouthwestAir some one comes on the plane taking 9 passengers Albuquerque via to my final destination on a flight 30 minutes early...you've got to be kidding. This cost more money on the back end. Btw this and TSA they make people not want to fly
The amount of sass coming from the @SouthwestAir flight attendants on this flight is giving me life 😂
@SouthwestAir I just checked both inbox and junk email. I did not receive the link. However, my husband just told me he received one on 12/27.
@SouthwestAir Yeah how do I do that?
@SouthwestAir what is up with the TPA flight to CMH? Even the gate agents don’t know #luvswabutwanttogohome
@SouthwestAir We were cancelled in midway yesterday. We had to come home bc there were no flights to our final desitination (Charleston). My wife and I both have outstanding flights to return home from Charleston - pittsburgh Saturday that we obviously wont need. Need a refund on them.
@SouthwestAir When did you send the link?
@SouthwestAir Hi there - very long wait times for customers relations on the phone all day. Over and hour still currently. Any other way to reach?
@SouthwestAir Like water? You ass kiss for anyone that have never flown with you and a lifetime customer you give this raggedy answer? Shame on you
@SouthwestAir Remember to alway book an extra flight on a different airline because #SouthwestAirlines may cancel your flight and leave In Mexico an extra day with no accommodations! Guess I’ll be starting the new year off by spending the night in Puerto Vallartas Airport. #yousucksouthwest!
@SouthwestAir disappointed after several years of A List I'm 3456 points short for 2020. Called today to try to buy points, was told an email was sent with a link that expired yesterday. I went back into my emails from you and see nothing with that link. What?
@SouthwestAir Your response doesn’t fix the problem that I bought miles before year end in good faith. Kind of a dialed in client service response tbh
the suitcase and I was so disappointed to see that the water portion of the Keurig was cracked. I tried to fill with water to see if we could use it, but we cannot. Does @SouthwestAir cover mishaps from travel like this?
We just got home from our flight from New Orleans from visiting family for Christmas. One of our gifts-a Keurig-we packed in a small suitcase and checked it in. We made sure to wrap items around it to protect it during the travels. When we got home, I opened(cont..)@SouthwestAir
Dear @SouthwestAir, flight 4421, you’ve always been good to me, why are you betraying me now, by pushing my first flight with my infant, it into the late night with 2 hours of delays? Y? Sincerely, -already-stressed-mother-now-even-more-stressed P.S I just want to go home 😭
So I requested a manager from @SouthwestAir call me and she just called me at 6:30pm on New Years Eve. Are ya kidding me?
@SouthwestAir over an hour delayed for an extremely #nervous #flyer? Yikes!
At least @SouthwestAir offered vouchers to compensate for the 5.5 hour delay. I’ll give them and their customer service credit for that. Happy New Year!
And now that the earlier flight has boarded the delay time for my flight has gone back up. Again how sway @SouthwestAir Jeana. This is so funny to me right now.
@SouthwestAir Guess I won’t know unless I take a random flight then 🤣🤣
@SouthwestAir do you do a countdown mid flight to ring in the new year? I’m just curious
Thanks @SouthwestAir for a great flight with an amazing crew!! (SW3870)
The cheesy jokes from the crew are half the reason I fly @SouthwestAir 😂😂
Super excited to have maintained my A-list status and earned a companion pass! I ❤️ flying @SouthwestAir and usually non-stop! Beaches and mountains here I come. #2020WillBeTheYearForTravel
@SouthwestAir I see you daily taking care of the daily crying babes you have. As a 10+ years customer, I more than expect than a standardized answer from you!
Was suppose to get back to LA at 645pm, now plane is delayed 4 hours and not leaving until 8pm IF it departs at all. Thanks for ruining NYE @SouthwestAir #fail #neveragain
@SouthwestAir Let me rephrase, my 3 family members plus I should I just sit quietly and accept your lack on delivery service?
@SouthwestAir So my 4 about to expire drinks vouchers should go void bc you couldn't supply an easy to west coast flight demand?
@SouthwestAir delayed my flight (For now...), breaking our hearts and ruining our New Years plans. #hope2020isbetter
by the end of the day @SouthwestAir and I are gonna fight fasureeee
Because of a plane change I’m gonna miss a bunch of time with my gf on our first NYE together... cutting it real close too. I’m not mad @SouthwestAir, just disappointed.
C'mon @SouthwestAir How come did you run out of sparkling wine during the new years flights?? Unacceptable
@SouthwestAir I guess training doesn’t happen at LGA. People standing in line for Chicago because that’s what the board says. But the flight is for ATL.
Tbh @SouthwestAir I wouldn't mind if you added another connection if it's with this crew. I want to celebrate the New Year with them. They're treating me like a drunken princess and I like it a lot.
@SouthwestAir I understand that Jeana, I just found it funny that the delay went from 30 mins to 10 mins in under 5 mins basically. Lol
@SouthwestAir Stay hot Southwest! Another delayed flight. Wrong flight destinations on the boards at the gates. Passengers having to help each other.
@SouthwestAir my flight has been delayed more than any other in the STL airport causing me to miss the first day of my ski trip in Montana. Considering this isnt my fault in any way and weather had nothing to do with it, (mechanical in Fort Meyers) can I be refunded for my hotel?
Half filled southwest flight to MSY, I’ll take it! @SouthwestAir maybe half price drinks as well?? 🙃
@SouthwestAir Do you know when the New Year’s Flight specials will become available. I know you all something up your sleeves.
Get to the airport flight shows 30 min delay, go try to get on an earlier flight orig flight now shows 10 min delay so I can't w/o paying. How sway @SouthwestAir. Oh well as long as I get to where I need to be to ring in the New Year.
@SouthwestAir I appreciate you taking the time to tweet me!! She filled one out, we’re just hoping maybe someone found it and sees one of our post about it!! Thank you again!
@SouthwestAir Only if I could give you the package of them to taste. You could smell that they were bad when the bag was opened.
@SouthwestAir I sent the DM thank you
After my 12hr delay and then cancelled flight at SFO for Thanksgiving, I used my @SouthwestAir credit for my return flight for Christmas. Now at my layover in Chicago, I’m delayed 4hrs, creeping quite close to that New Years hour... with talks of flight cancellation. Goodbye ‘19.
so excited to start my new life stranded at the chicago airport thank you @SouthwestAir for really fucking up the end of 2019 for me
@SouthwestAir whenever a family books a flight with young children do you proactively offer preboarding? I’ve been on way too many flights that get delayed for take off because other passengers are asked to give up their seat(s) to allow a family to sit together.
@SouthwestAir Man there’s this cute guy who works for Southwest from Houston how can I find him 😆
@SouthwestAir You don’t understand....I’ve been winning with Southwest all work season long! I’ve taken 16-18 southwest flights since July and I can say thumbs up overall!
@SouthwestAir Unfortunately I'm avoiding using Southwest again
Changed my flight and got 7 points back, THank you @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir And now we are at Hobby and the gate isn’t open here either...#sigh It must be me.
No bathroom line, napkins, toilet paper, soap and clean ✅✅✅ best New Years party = @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Always Southwest never JetBlue should be their new motto
@SouthwestAir JetBlue takes advantage of it's poorest customers by keeping their money if you need to cancel Southwest does not
Hey @SouthwestAir! I accidentally left my external hard drive on a LGA to DAL flight. The photos of my now fiancé proposing to me are on there. It’s been 11 days since I filed the report but haven’t heard back. Any chance you can help this fiancée get photos of her moment back?
@SouthwestAir JetBlue doesn't allow cancelation they take your money and get richer
@SouthwestAir Not that you needed another one but just in case always fly Southwest never JetBlue why you ask
I love @SouthwestAir but my last 2 flights involved people walking around the cabin while still on a taxiway (and they weren’t told to sit down) and someone in the bathroom when we landed. Just crazy.
@SouthwestAir Not that you needed another one but just in case always fly Southwest never JetBlue why you ask
@SouthwestAir Haha I don't blame you, just the airport
Thanks for waiting until 4pm to tell us our 4pm flight has been delayed four hours @SouthwestAir. Ruined NYE and without any warning.
@SouthwestAir He did for tomorrow but he missed his NYE plans with his friends.
@SouthwestAir how do you know that an 8pm flight is going to be delayed at 6am that morning...now there is a further delay. We route to Dallas to avoid being stuck in St. Louis now this! You people have got to do better! #cantgetway #notontime
Thanks for the early 2020 gift @SouthwestAir - great gift of arriving one hour early on a cross country flight!
5 minutes until we take off and there is no plane outside. An employee was also a sarcastic jerk to a patron. Plus, my flight yesterday was already cancelled. Nice job @SouthwestAir
Have been sitting on the ground half as long as we were in the air. Welcome to LaGarbage. #nyc #laguardia @SouthwestAir
Anyone have one of those @SouthwestAir promo codes they want to send my way ✈️
@SouthwestAir I booked air travel yesterday and only received a copy of the itinerary, not a copy of the receipt showing how much was paid. When I go to the 'manage reservations' area, there is still no option to receive a receipt. Please help.
First, our flight was cancelled and we got stuck in Chicago overnight. Then, our flight home today was delayed over an hour. I’m tired and ready to be at home. @SouthwestAir 😩🥺
I think your pilot drunk bro @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir horrible service once again. So disappointing
.@SouthwestAir hello! Received notice of a flight delay, but it doesn’t make sense why. Could you share the details for flight 4423 departing from San Diego?
A liitle bid shady @SouthwestAir that the chance to buy additional miles for A-list ended yesterday and not the last day of the year. They still let me buy 2,000 miles today that do not count.
Important update: The 3:50 BNA-JAX @SouthwestAir flight appears to be 75% orange.
@SouthwestAir I upgraded my access to end up sitting at the gate for 2 hours. I would like to ask that my upgrade fees be refunded.
@SouthwestAir we were supposed to leave at 1:45 PM and we are STILL here.
@SouthwestAir Speaking for the entire plane that was supposed to have left for a short less-than-1-hr flight to Buffalo from Chicago, not understanding WHY we are still sitting here
@SouthwestAir I am stuck in Tampa. Flight 1141 -2pm flight delayed to 6:40 or 8:20. Very disappointing!!! Second time in 6 months we have a 6 + hour delay.
@SouthwestAir I did. They reimbursed me for the guitar, but that doesn’t really make up for not being able to play it at Christmas and record while I was in town, which is why I brought it. And having to go through the trouble of ordering another one and buying a new case.
@SouthwestAir Not when 4421 STL-SLC is delayed 90 minutes screwing up dinner plans!
@SouthwestAir The 1.5+ hour wait on the tarmac for flight 2376 on Dec 30 wasn't fun. Me and my family missed our ride and had didn't get home until after 1am....when we were expecting to be back by 10pm
@SouthwestAir Well, the fasten seatbelt sign is lit up so I’m guessing that I have no choice 🤔
Kudos to the person who asked me if I would like a wheelchair instead of assuming I need one. @SouthwestAir ❤️
Such a great check-in experience with @SouthwestAir ticket counter associate Camilla in FLL. #SouthwestAirlines #customerexperience
@SouthwestAir Obviously you are magical; we started moving about 10 seconds after your reply posted 😊
All is going well. The employees are so great. The flight attendant walked me to my gate and someone bought me a sandwich and water. They asked me if I would like the safety info in braille which made me happy. Thank you @SouthwestAir for being so kind and accommodating.
@SouthwestAir I am super disappointed. I received zero concession or consideration over our flight being cancelled out of MDW last night. I completely understand it was weather related, but I also paid for direct flights for 8 people which cost a TON of money and the best
Hey @SouthwestAir, SWA 3013 (BOS —&gt; SFO) flight crew are amazing professionals and equally lovely people. Wicked awesome flight! Thank you Marcia!
@SouthwestAir We had 1.1" of snow and only 24 flights cancelled this morning. Can't see how in middle of Chicago winter that this was weather cancellation!
pls @SouthwestAir check on the pilot for flight #6304 bc this landing... whew chile!
Hey @SouthwestAir you need a VIP lounge in Cancun. Maybe a partnership with AreoMexico?
i have yet to fly a @SouthwestAir flight that isn’t delayed. Literally, every single time.
Teddy the flight attendant on my @SouthwestAir flight 5980 Kansas City to Houston has gone above and beyond for me traveling with my two little ones solo. 👏👏👏 thank you!!
@SouthwestAir I logged onto WiFi on my mobile device as well. I think the underlying issue here is that you literally cannot access the inflight entertainment options once you purchase/connect to WiFi because of redirects. The logic itself should be fixed?
@SouthwestAir If its policy, then be consistent. But I'm not sure why A-List member wouldnt be extended that courtesy. Not friendly policy to frequent fliers. So much for the holiday spirit!
@SouthwestAir big fail this morning as my husband's flight from Midway cancelled but not bc of weather. He rebookedfor tomorrow online as he couldn't get thru on phone, had to pay a fee and it's not a nonstop. Missing his dad's 85th birthday celebration tonight too!
@SouthwestAir help us stressed out mama out! It would cost us almost $1100 to change our flight from Nashville to Denver departing at 8:30 tomorrow night and I’m flying with two toddlers. Please waive the fee and let me leave on the direct at 2:30!! It would aNew Year’s savior.
Not a Happy New Year's Eve at Hartsfield @SouthwestAir. Traveling with my kids, I'm A-List and they're not, and gate agent Rod T wouldnt let them board with me. We travel alot and have never been told they couldnt board. Supervisor says its policy. Clearly never enforced before.
@SouthwestAir Southwest has failed today, cancelled my husband's flight from Midway this morning for unknown reason, not the weather! He had to rebook for a flight tomorrow that was not non-stop. And he's missing the new year celebration of his Dad's 86th birthday tomorrow!
@SouthwestAir First time flying southwest in years and the worst customer service that I have ever experienced from an airline. You can’t transport my baggage to me after cancelled flights? You should have it ready at my destination, especially since you wouldn’t pull it.
@SouthwestAir I have been offered a voucher in lieu for the damage on site. However, because I fly Southwest constantly, it is more important that this be formally reported and counted in the ongoing survey of damage to medical equipment.
@SouthwestAir It's less of a one off/browser issue, but a corner case that was likely missed. It pretty much guarantees that A-List preferred members have to choose between WiFi Access or Inflight Entertainment (unless they have multiple devices).
hands down @SouthwestAir is my top airline
I like to be positive but the flight delays due to radio issue with @SouthwestAir today has been beyond ridiculous! And when no one can at the gate nor online chat can help you with a seemingly easy fix you now know why your friends call them Southworst. very disappointing!
@SouthwestAir So flight 4640, STL-MDW was supposed to depart at 9:35 AM...now scheduled to depart at 3 PM due to mechanical issue (regular maintenance anyone?) 5.5 hr delay for 40 min flight. Will reconsider flying Southwest in the future.
@SouthwestAir Yes she left a message and sent a email
@SouthwestAir Awh thank you Victoria! I’ll send a message now 😊
When your boyfriend's flight gets bumped so now he can't go see his aunt who is is coma and may not make it ... Not cool @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir thank you for rescuing me &amp; my pup in Denver to get home! I originally had a united ticket, which despite giving them all the correct info. They wouldn’t let us fly at checkin, mid way on our journey. There policy 4months old. Told to figure out how to get back.
Going to miss @SouthwestAir a list status by 2 flights this year 😭
@SouthwestAir There is no “if” about it.
@SouthwestAir We really do Luv you but you have to let us get to the gate at Dallas Love. This flight 5510 over your shoulder on the tarmac...over and out.
@SouthwestAir, when is BNA (Nashville, TN) gonna see those $39 fares??? Thank you and so much love!!
@SouthwestAir Not as good when they’re not in the plane shape 🤣✈️
@SouthwestAir I had a number of flights the past few weeks but only created an account today. Can I add those?
i am craving @SouthwestAir’s plane cookies 😩
@SouthwestAir That’s cold blooded. I like it. One stipulation... you have to break the news to my soon to be ex-companion. I don’t have the courage.
@SouthwestAir is definitely unorganized and inefficient!! Completely disappointed
@SouthwestAir wouldn’t pay for a hotel even though im stranded in chicago for a day and a half and they cancelled 2 flights
getting stuck in chicago for 36 hours with limited food and sleep is not ideal. thanks @SouthwestAir
Thanks @SouthwestAir for delaying the flight to Indy so much that now everyone is missing their New Years plans. 🙃🙂
One last flight today on @SouthwestAir before my A-List status expires tonight. 😭 It was fun while it lasted!
Missed keeping my @SouthwestAir A List by ONE flight because I didn’t read the fine print 😭😭😭😭😭😭. Not a good way to start the new year.
@SouthwestAir I am so upset at your customer service! I had points deleted from my account and nobody will help me!!
Hey @SouthwestAir! Your gate agent at STL just made up a new rule that would either leave my 8 year old having to board by himself or make my whole family wait for 20 people to jump ahead of us. Thought you were the good one
@SouthwestAir making me sign for bags that they mangled in the first place and then watching them launch them on to the belt #priceless
@SouthwestAir is a mess right now
@SouthwestAir We have our gate. I will stop panicking now.
@SouthwestAir 🤣🤣Well played, Jeana! Despite our disappointment, we still think Southwest is FINtastic!
Can't wait to never fly @SouthwestAir ever again. I logged into Twitter for the first time in years so I could tweet at them. Trash airline.
@SouthwestAir do better Southwest. Sitting on the tarmac inhaling jet exhaust an hour past scheduled takeoff? #3848
@SouthwestAir great flight this morning from Chicago! Thank you for the wonderful customer service. You’re flight attendants were fantastic
@SouthwestAir I don’t know. Sea Tac to Ohare. Left at 6:45 am pacific time.
@SouthwestAir Thank you- we spoke to your customer relations team directly this morning and they were able to assist
@SouthwestAir we are trapped on your airplane!! We need an update. Seattle to Chicago.
This year ago today, @SouthwestAir &amp;amp; America's Workers, comm… TERRIFIC! #IndependenceDay
@SouthwestAir I canceled my compainion and mine’s reservation yesterday over the phone but I didn’t receive an email confirmation that it was nor did I receive the points back.
It's official. I lose my @SouthwestAir A-List Status today. In mourning, those two years of status were AMAZING.
It's taking us a plane, train, bus, car, and more than $150 out-of-pocket to get home to Chicago after @SouthwestAir canceled our flight with no warning last night. Kind of surprised, to be honest — I'm usually their biggest fan.
I am seeing everyone else getting vouchers for their delayed/cancelled flights today yet here I am stuck in Baltimore for 4 hours because of a cancelled flight and they are telling me they can’t provide me with anything?? Come on @SouthwestAir, please do better. Highly annoyed.
@SouthwestAir I just DM'd my reservation number to you
@SouthwestAir I did, and I’m sixth in line for standby on another flight.
@SouthwestAir is seriously the best...they just threw a dance party and set up cornhole at my gate in Burbank and they're legit handing out money for flights. What a wonderful way to start the day! 😊
@SouthwestAir i have a Luv voucher expiring in few days, and unfortunately, won't be able to use it by then. any way to extend this voucher for the 2nd time? TIA
@SouthwestAir I need to get a flight I took this month applied to my frequent flyer account. How can I do this? Thank you!
Dear @SouthwestAir, In the busiest travel season (this was the worst I’ve ever seen LAS, MDW &amp; BDL), your service was top-notch, funny &amp; amazing. Additionally, I had bad weather on 4/6 landings- your pilots navigated/landed them to perfection. Thank you from a satisfied customer.
@SouthwestAir How is that every single time I fly from Memphis to Dallas the flight is delayed for over 1-hour? THERE IS NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY ON THE ENTIRE ROUTE FOR 24-HOURS!! Also, your kiosk set up in Memphis is 3rd world at best
@SouthwestAir - how are you gonna just change someone’s return flight home from vacation to the following day? Are you paying for my extra night in a hotel? Or do you expect me to just sleep at the airport terminal?. #usucksw
@SouthwestAir Thanks for being the best airline!!
@SouthwestAir Your apologies aren’t getting me to my destination any faster, Larissa. Paperwork shouldn’t take an hour+.
I flew home and now back on @SouthwestAir and both times my flight has been delayed 30 minutes. Fortunately, I got a long layover just in case this happened
@SouthwestAir thanks for delaying our flight for an aircraft swap. Now we only have 25 minutes to make our connection and SW won't bump up our boarding spots to an open A 1-15. We can pay for them if available at the gate tho...smh😠
@SouthwestAir So that’s a no on the drink tickets?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for canceling my flight, not telling me until I got to the airport, changing my boarding pass to C, and getting me on a flight 5 hours later than I was supposed to leave. Job well done. Ps. Your customer service reps are less than helpful. 👏🏼
@SouthwestAir Once again, you guys were absolutely awesome. On my return flight from Orlando to Columbus, OH two days ago, your Orlando crew was exceptional, especially Naheed at gate 103. Kudos to her. Also kudos to the cabin crew on the flight. Keep up the awesome work!!!
@SouthwestAir great flight attendants on WN 5467 from LAS to DAL. Love their attitude. Shout out to all including special shout out to flight attendant Carol.
@SouthwestAir Uhhh flight 6329 is out of San Jose to PDX at 4:20pm....
s/o to @SouthwestAir CMH for being too lazy to check the lost and found for our luggage for 5 days and then refusing to give us a voucher that we were promised
The only way to spend the last day of 2019 is booking the first trips of 2020. Cancun —&gt; Seattle —&gt; NYC @SouthwestAir I need more drink tickets, thanks.
@SouthwestAir I have a flight to pdx out of San Jose at 4:20 today...is there any chance I can move onto an earlier flight? Thanks
@SouthwestAir your boarding procedure is trash.
I opened my mail today and got $2 in cash from Nielsen and 4 free drink coupons from @SouthwestAir. Happy New Year to me! 🥳🥳
@SouthwestAir Yes everything was handled once I arrived at the airport thank you!
@SouthwestAir Yes but who wants to go through that ? Y’all need to get it together
Rise and shine because at 7am on my @SouthwestAir flight a man proposed on his way to Vegas.. Then in a baller move, he airdropped a picture of them as a couple, the ring, and the proposal video to everyone on the plane. ~romantic~
@SouthwestAir Ummmm......We got 1” of snow.... it’s Chicago, that’s nothing
@SouthwestAir That voucher means nothing with the inconvenience and extra money that had to be spent. Like i said i’m going higher up cause no i’m not satisfied with a little voucher. This was a extreme inconvenience and not handled properly. I’m done talking about it
@SouthwestAir TWO DAYS WITHOUT LUGGAGE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT HOW EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED
@SouthwestAir Your employees lost my luggage and gave me the run around for two days in the first place and i received my luggage in this condition. Y’all already have a major issue with me at this point
@SouthwestAir I was contacted by the Orlando Baggage office regarding my lost item and given a file number. Any chance I can talk to a person so I can arrange the return of this item?
@SouthwestAir the SWA Flight 1204 was cancelled (chi-&gt;Austin) today and none of your customer service seems to have information that has cancelled my nye trip. Any information and some drink coupons would be appreciated. Thanks
How many people are flying @SouthwestAir today just to earn a #companionpass? 🙋🏼‍♀️
First bad experience with @SouthwestAir. Flight got canceled this morning, not any of southwest fault. But the compromise was to get on a flight that arrives 12 hours later for free and we lose a day, or we pay roughly $400 more for a midday flight with a layover? And they...
@SouthwestAir Thank you for letting me know it was inside. Customer service has told us twice that we cannot rebook anywhere except the airport because we checked bags. We tried for hours yesterday as seats became available momentarily as others rebooked. Is this not the case?
Hey @SouthwestAir why did you cancel my NYE flight and rebook me to a flight that lands AFTER my event?! 😭
@SouthwestAir I would like to give a BIG shoutout to Vilma at Orlando airport for helping me and my husband get to Ft. Lauderdale on 12/21. YOU ROCK!!!
Be careful peeps! If you’re flying over the holidays, stay away from @SouthwestAir as their goal is to take your money without providing a service! Consider yourself warned! #horribleservice
Why is the last minute before you can hit check in for a @SouthwestAir flight feel like the longest minute ever??? #groupA #flysouthwest
Flown @SouthwestAir the past few days and have been so relieved! Thanks y’all!
When the brands you love betray you it always stings the most. @SouthwestAir say it ain’t so
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the reply. Understood but your name is on the card and it represents you. Maybe you should also reevaluate your relationship with Chase? Hopefully my next card gives me SWA RR points. Let's end the year on a high. Thank you Steve!
@SouthwestAir Not my point. Don’t say points earned through 12/31 if all the points I’m earning from 11/26 (when my closing date happens to occur) to 12/31 go towards my RR but not actually towards the pass.
@SouthwestAir Totally! Was hoping to have been able to talk to someone in case there was a sliver of a chance to get on another flight and salvage plans or at least get some drink coupons out of it for a future fight! I’m super sad about this, but still love Southwest.
@SouthwestAir Please know I am from Chicago originally and it is common knowledge that Southwest and Midway are the only options for our crazy winter conditions. If you want to travel in the winter, you book Southwest. Very disappointed. Yesterday’s multiple cancellations made no sense.
@SouthwestAir They put us on a flight departing on 01/01/2020. You should compensate us for accommodation. Again, it was your fault to have a faulty plane in service. It was not the weather that delayed the flight departure.
@SouthwestAir Yes, and those flights were also canceled. Reason: Strong winds in Chicago. Yet American, United, Delta all flew in and out of Chicago. Even Southwest flew into Chicago in between the two times both my flights were canceled. Midways website stated travel conditions were normal.
@SouthwestAir Took nearly an hour to get bags. Would’ve been more manageable if your employees displayed any empathy or provided updates instead of getting irritated with passengers looking for answers. Really poor customer service after a long day of travel with an infant.
@SouthwestAir This the only time I’ve been offered anything
@SouthwestAir MAD props to Southwest Airlines for quick &amp; friendly service with my account issue!
@SouthwestAir That doesn’t help me at all having to do more traveling and more money to get MY luggage that i ddn misplace so whatever
@SouthwestAir Yeah I did all they offering is $100 voucher, this the 2nd time this happen with you guys ! That $100 don’t help my inconvenience
@SouthwestAir Great, so "we know there was probably an issue processing your confirmed flight, but we won't do anything to help." Thanks for nothing, I remember back when y'all had great service, but after a couple bad interactions y'all are no longer an airline worth paying more for.
@SouthwestAir flew nonstop 2096 yesterday from bwi to sdf. My bag (and that of at least a dozen other folks) never got put on the plane. No one at Southwest can tell me where it is - whether it’s even still at bwi! - or when it’s coming. Please help! Much needed items are in it.
@SouthwestAir Thanks. We don't mind the xancellation- it was safety-- but only in person booking for rebooking?
@SouthwestAir No problem Kolby, thanks for your concern. Happy New Years
@SouthwestAir Expecting an 80 year old woman to sit in a wheelchair all night is more than discomfort!! I did not say it was your intention to disrupt travel. What you must do is take responsibility and treat customers as though they are valued when you do disrupt travel!!!
not only did @SouthwestAir cancel all flights out of midway due to THEIR negligence but my bags are no where to be found. just lost a VERY loyal customer.
@SouthwestAir I slide into a company’s DMs and still no response... I suck at DMs
@SouthwestAir I want a refund for this portion of the trip. I specifically paid more so I could get home today.
@SouthwestAir My guy at the gate right now is just roasting everyone at 7 in the morning, y’all encourage that?
My in-laws @SouthwestAir flight was cancelled due to wind (NBD), so we had a surprise visit (3 hrs south) and kids are thrilled... But now they have to leave to airport because rebooking has to be done in-person. Such a pain to not be able to use technology to rebook flights. :'(
@SouthwestAir Understood. But 30 minutes prior to boarding... seemed a little fishy that it was chalked up to weather related as everyone in chicago we contacted said there wasn't anything. No worries, we still think you guys are great; just not as great because of our inconvenience. ;)
@SouthwestAir - friends elderly parents are being told they have to travel 2+ hrs to the airport itself to rebook a canceled flight from last night.
@SouthwestAir So if I paid for early bird check in, is my A boarding spot protected?
@SouthwestAir I'm attempting to send it now
@SouthwestAir We called last night, the problem is we got a confirmation page that everything was booked, but then never got charged or an email. Seems like your website processing had an issue and now we're SOL. Major bummer that you all won't honor the price we should have been charged.
@SouthwestAir employees are always doing the most ... let’s leave these jokes in 2019
@SouthwestAir Still didn’t get an answer on what happened to my bags. Were they outside all night? Why couldn’t we collect them? I have to go shopping today just to get by because we couldn’t get accommodated on a flight for TWO days
@SouthwestAir Thank you Allison! Yes. Have deleted &amp; reinstalled. Have also rebooted phone a d cleared the cache for the app.
Hi @SouthwestAir! I noticed some MDW prices dropped moderately. I’ve tried to change my booked 2020 flights to the new prices. I keep receiving IT errors on both my mobile app and laptop computer when I try to change flights. Are you guys aware of this issue?
@SouthwestAir Will do! I’ve got my money on the guy with the seatbelt extender and 4 egg McMuffin wrappers. However, the guy who had 3 cups of coffee and an egg salad sandwich for breakfast is putting up a pretty good fight.
@SouthwestAir You were right. It was magical
Nobody’s bags were even on this flight????!! @SouthwestAir we need to talk about this
@SouthwestAir I’m finna film a video for my onlyfans with one of y’all attendants y’all trying to sponsor some young talent?
@SouthwestAir gave me a voucher for waiting an extra 4 hours on a delayed flight last week and now I’ve been stuck in another airport overnight for 12 hours and absolutely nothing.
@SouthwestAir Unable to log into mobile app on Android phone. Error 400518024. My credentials are fine, as I can get into full site via computer. Please help!
I’ve had to buy more clothes &amp; all, i want a reimbursement or something for real @SouthwestAir this is for real unacceptable
Two days without my stuff a huge inconvenience @SouthwestAir i’ve had to buy more clothes &amp; all because nobody wants to follow through. I’m over it
@SouthwestAir flt 792 cancelled, rented car, need verification luggage will get to BUF. Need to talk to someone. Pls call me ASAP 716-553-5289
That wait of shame when you’re @SouthwestAir boarding group C 🙄
@SouthwestAir really littt!! U basically get 4 free bags with them! That’s so clutch for the vacation
I’m tired of getting screwed by @SouthwestAir #bigmad
@SouthwestAir I just paid $8 for WiFi to tweet about the fart crossfire I’m caught between. Two distinct assholes at work here. The $8 is worth every penny.
@SouthwestAir any idea why flight #5916 is delayed? Haven’t heard anything from crew onboard.
Entire exit row to myself. Always great to fly with @SouthwestAir 😍
@SouthwestAir HAPPY NEW YEAR SOUTHWEST AIRLINES🎉🎊
@SouthwestAir your service in STL is horrific. That’s all.
Happy New Year @SouthwestAir why are all of your agents in St Louis nasty? I just want to get home😥
remind me not to fly @SouthwestAir again
@SouthwestAir we are on a 1215 fly from FLL via ATL to STL....how can I switch to the 1010 non-stop? My wife and I both have companion passes...each on of our kids are the companion? Any help?
@SouthwestAir Another great flight, even in less than ideal weather conditions. The crew on flight 5438 (12/31) was perfect, especially Josh. Thanks!
Traveling on @SouthwestAir today and someone is farting so badly I think it’s going to be on the news.
@SouthwestAir Y’all got it ❤️ legroom is dope
I take back what I said. @SouthwestAir has the most legroom I’ve ever had on a flight (excluding first class) and the WiFi is cheap. AND no corn chips 😍😍
@SouthwestAir Yes. She said there is nothing she can do but notate our account
@SouthwestAir The pilots put the pedal to the metal, for sure, and Dispatch must have called in some favors with the jetstream. 😁 Happy New Year!!
@SouthwestAir no all your flights are booked, which is why i booked back in august. the only flight to be canceled there today for no reason
@SouthwestAir 70 open seats on today’s flight! That’s what I’m talking about!
@SouthwestAir Ahh now understand. Ok, thanks!
@SouthwestAir Thanks Dillon. I’ll keep you updated
@SouthwestAir I drove an hour in a snowstorm each way to the airport to get assistance since website &amp; phone were no help. Weather cancellations happen. For a company who claims safety is #1, tho, having your phone AND website go down? Not a good look, and definitely didn’t make anyone safer.
On a Southwest flight from Love Field to NOLA and there has to be at LEAST 30-40 decked out Baylor fans on board! Hoping this is a good sign of the turnout we will have at the game 😁 @SouthwestAir do your flight attendants know how to lead a #sicem ??
@SouthwestAir I appreciate being safety conscious but I’m curious why other airlines seemed to be able to operate without incident. If accommodate you mean being booked for a flight home today just to get bumped to tomorrow then yeah they were accommodated.
@SouthwestAir tell me why every single flight going there before and after is on time but mine is canceled. how can one airline ruin my entire holiday
@SouthwestAir why do you FALSELY advertise comp. pass pts earned thru 12/31? My pts post on the 2nd of every mo, so I’m screwed out of all the points I earn in Dec. 2500 pts away, won’t get the pass bc of this biased loophole. Loyal customer pretty put off of flying your airline
flight got canceled and @SouthwestAir won’t even give me a frikken DRINK coupon!!! get me on a delta flight stat!!!!
@SouthwestAir I sent an email about my stolen item from my luggage while traveling with southwest all I got was a complaint number and nothing else was done. I’m very disappointed
@SouthwestAir Yes, please. Is there a way to have the value of the cancelled flight credited to my account for future use? Additionally, every flight to my destination was booked and I had to book last minute with another airline because of this - is there a way to be compensated for this?
I will fly @SouthwestAir as often as I can solely for the fact that they have the best customer service #thankyou
Hey @SouthwestAir can you tell me the reason for the delay showing for tonight's flight 3973 MKE to PHX? Cutting my connection very close.
Just got a text... at 3am that my 10am flight is cancelled. With zero explanation. Just says it’s cancelled. Now I’m on hold for damn near an hour trying to figure this out... off zero sleep. Great job @SouthwestAir 👎🏽
Absolutely ridiculous @SouthwestAir that I get to the airport only to find out you guys cancelled my flight and then rebooked it (to a date that doesn't work btw) all without even telling me. No email. No call no text. #wtf #southwest 🤦🏻‍♂️
Yo @SouthwestAir my family’s flight home from Midway this morning was cancelled but I can’t rebook online due to companion pass. Wait time to rebook on phone was estimated at 120 minutes (!) 😱 All flights today are showing Sold Out online. Gotta get home. Are we hosed?
@SouthwestAir you have been MISERABLY disappointing. Not only did you cancel only ONE flight... ours, but you also have me on hold for 3 HOURS and 20 MINUTES. So we cannot even TRY to change our flight. Thanks for ruining our trip 2 years in the making.
@SouthwestAir My flight #946 was the only flight cancelled this morning. Can you please inform me why? I need to leave for work today. All other flights say not cancelled.
Y’all pray for me. I’m flying @SouthwestAir and they like to serve corn chips.
@SouthwestAir canceling just my flight out of Midway on New Years Eve? Huge bummer. Missing my first New Years with my partner and his family? Devastating. I just want to go home.
My flight this morning was cancelled and now I can’t get home until Wednesday, which means I won’t be able to spend New Years Eve with Wes. I spent almost two hours on hold only for @SouthwestAir to tell me there’s nothing they can do. Pretty devastated rn, not gonna lie.
@SouthwestAir Yes! The airport finally got us the information we needed. Thanks
@SouthwestAir I deleted my confirmation number. FYI before you shed some light on your site please share it with your employees since I called before I actually booked the rental. I wanted to confirm what I read on YOUR SITE and YOUR EMPLOYEE confirmed it so I booked it!
aaaaand looks like I will still be in Chicago for New Years. Thanks @SouthwestAir for canceling my flight and making it nearly impossible to book another.
@SouthwestAir flight 2828 OAK -BWI cancelled with no explanation. Unable to rebook using companion pass. Had to pay full fare and lost early bird. Been on hold waiting to speak to someone for an hour and 26 min. What's going in?!?!
lmao EVERY flight before and after on time but mine canceled? terrible. how do i discontinue my @SouthwestAir credit card they’re trash (and everything else sold out 😂)
How is my flight oversold ... Really @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir y’all really making me angry!! I fly you all so much, but you’ve cancelled BOTH of my flights within 24 hours AND won’t release my bags so I can’t even rebook unless it’s in person which is CRAZY.
@SouthwestAir I gave up on trying to reach a rep after 1.5 hrs on hold... guess my only option now is to cancel my trip entirely which is a super disappointing end to 2019.
@SouthwestAir, any way to help a stranded traveler on New Years Eve. Flights through MDW canceled due to weather.
@SouthwestAir I did for a morning flight, which is awesome but spending the night in an airport chair was not! 🤦🏼‍♀️😕
@SouthwestAir my flight was cancelled and there were no available flights to my destination - how can i get my ticket cost credited and a reimbursement for my new flight as a result of this?
This is the worst @SouthwestAir experience I've ever had. Their workers aren't even trying to speed things up and get people on their flights.
@SouthwestAir On the second cancelled flight in a row, gonna get home 2 days late and I can’t get my bags? Need a little more effort here Southwest.
@SouthwestAir anything we can do about this C group boarding from #BNA TO #LAX I went from A 30 to C 19 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼#MiddleSeatProblems
.@SouthwestAir staff in #BDL were working hard to try to get a sea of people through baggage checking. Thank you to all of the staff there that got us through to our plane.
@SouthwestAir Shut up William you Fucking walnut
@SouthwestAir SWA flight was just cancelled with no notification while I'm en route to the airport. Phone wait times are almost two hours and I cannot rebook online. Can you help?
@SouthwestAir my 8 am NYE flight to meet my good friend I haven’t seen in a year got canceled at 3 am, all other flights are sold out via the app, and now I’ve been on hold for an hour (and falling asleep) ☹️ #sos #HappyNewYear
@SouthwestAir Please respond to my DM ASAP.
@SouthwestAir Not only do you inexplicably cancel my flight less than 6 hours before the flight on NYE. I’ve been on hold for over 90 minutes. Inexcusable! I’m stuck!
@SouthwestAir Still in need of urgent assistance... Please DM me back. 🗿
@SouthwestAir these response times are an absolute FAILURE Never again with your airline.
@SouthwestAir what is the deal with all the flight cancellation coming out of ABIA and heading to Chicago? Rebooked the only flight available for today but that one has now been delayed.
Hey @SouthwestAir you ignore dms for an hour, call wait times are over two hours, HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO GET ANYTHING DONE ON TIME IF NO ONE CAN HELP ME?!?
@SouthwestAir Please DM me back Southwest, it is urgent
@SouthwestAir Please DM me back. My flight has been cancelled a third time. This is urgent.
We arrived at the hotel and checked in and got to the room at 2 AM to get up at 5am to catch a shuttle back to the airport. I did get $200 off my next flight but after all this not even Worth it😳😬😒🙄🤬😡#southwest #youneedtobebetter @SouthwestAir
Hey @SouthwestAir...you just cancelled my flight home for a late Christmas, you have over a 2 hour hold time on your phone line and your website is spitting out an error every time I try to rebook...can you help?
@SouthwestAir please please please help... my number is 7732409046... I need immediate help with my flight please please please see this
@SouthwestAir I have a flight that is booked to leave at 6:15 am from BWI at 3:42 am I got a text message that says the flight in cancelled.. but online it says the flight is on time. I am having trouble reaching your agents by phone but I need help immediately
@SouthwestAir Why is there a 120 minute wait for an agent? Why is was my flight cancelled but still showing on time to depart?
Another Christmas, another year that @SouthwestAir baggage handlers have damaged my luggage #SouthwestAirlines
@SouthwestAir from PHX to Austin. My husband is a big strong guy with broad shoulders. Only seat available was middle between two obese (300+ pounds each) people. There was literally no room for him. ... #FlightDelayHorrorStories
@SouthwestAir it is unacceptable to land at BWI at 2:30am, only to have to wait 30+ minutes and counting for our bags to arrive. Your customer service reps in baggage claim are super rude to all of us asking for updates.
@SouthwestAir DM sent. Please review, thank you.
@SouthwestAir and all you offer us is a mere $75 voucher? For mishandled luggage that your staff just grabbed and threw on the carousel? Fix your policies. I’ll never ever fly your airline ever again. Such a disgrace!
@SouthwestAir you guys not only mishandled our luggage, you also went as far as leaving the luggage in LAX, we have been waiting here at the airport for 45 minutes only to find out that our bags didn’t make it. We won’t be home until later in the night. This is disgraceful!!
Medical emergency landing with @SouthwestAir tonight. I am sending prayers for the individuals’ health and I thank all those nurses and flight attendants that helped this evening. You all are angels.
Having to wait 45 mins for your bags &lt;&lt;&lt; @SouthwestAir explain yourself
@SouthwestAir I understand you don’t have control over the weather, but you do have control over your customer service’s efficiency. We stood in line 3hrs to rebook our ticket. This isn’t the 1st time flights are cancelled bc of weather. #DoBetter #MDW #BetterProtocol
@SouthwestAir it's your fault to have a faulty plane in service. We are paying for your mistakes.
@SouthwestAir After dozens of flights a year for several years I think I’m switching airlines. Up your hiring standards. What a shame. #LastFlight
Hi @SouthwestAir Flight 1347 had some issue with WiFi. They spent time in digging into that issue. During that time all flights from MDW airport were cancelled due to weather. IT IS YOUR FAULT. We should be compensated for this. Please check flight recordings for details.
@SouthwestAir your #CustomerService is lacking- BIG TIME. Flight canceled. NO hotel. NO travel help to relatives. And the biggest FU is NO retrieval of my checked bags. I have to #hope &amp; #pray they show up tomorrow when I finally get into town.
@SouthwestAir I was told repeatedly that SW won’t comp any flights or compensate lost hotel or rental car costs, must be nice not to have accountability. Quickly losing a customer, sorry 6 customers.
@SouthwestAir Our current flight with our four kids is two and a half hours late getting in 2:30 am. The rental car place will be closed so we have to sleep in the airport till 6. Does SWA care, nope, not one person tried to arrange a car, comp a ticket or make any other comment than Sorry!
I’ve flown on half broken planes from the 80’s in Belarus, and even then the service was better than @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir wow... 20 minutes on hold and then you hang up? Disappointed? Please.
@SouthwestAir **Julian Thanks a few drink vouchers for my flight next month would be cool🥃
@SouthwestAir where are our bags? We are here in ATL at claim 3 and the belt stopped about 30 minutes ago. Please fix the jam so we can get home.
@SouthwestAir Also tried the call back option. You returned my call an hour later, but put me on hold and disconnected me when you closed.
12:15 am CT, delayed by 90 min and there’s no gate available... in San Antonio? Um @SouthwestAir...
My @SouthwestAir flight was delayed an hour and it made me cranky, but then the flight attendants were so nice that it changed my mood. #SouthwestAirlines #canigetarefund #forthedelay
@SouthwestAir shout out to Danielle at Houston’s Hobby Airport. She was super committed to all of us stuck here due to crappy weather in CHI and MIL. Seriously, give that woman a raise!
@SouthwestAir what happens to the bags southwest wouldn’t let us collect at Midway? Are they outside all night? I have items that will freeze and break.
Yooo, @SouthwestAir got me messed up right now. Was supposed to leave at 8:45 and I’m still on the plane waiting to leave and it’s almost 10pm WTF?!! I didn’t pay extra to change my flight for this!!!
@SouthwestAir my niece is stuck at midway airport in Chicago and even though she is 19 she’s still a kid and she is given a flight 2 days later on 1/1 that isn’t customer service. No hotel voucher no food voucher nothing. This is unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir Normally I have zero issues with you guys but this time it was pretty horrendous. My luggage got lost, first flight multiple delays, delays again for the second flight returning home. This has been a pretty dreadful experience.
Someone with SMF as their destination left a drink ticket in the pocket of my seat. It had an expiration date of 12/31/19. To no one’s surprise, it was on a @SouthwestAir flight. They, and their customers, are simply the best. Thank you, Southwest friend.
It's my first time flying @SouthwestAir and my flight delay is longer than my actual flight
ya girl is still hella mad but a WONDERFUL man named Dexter managed to get us both seats on a plane tomorrow afternoon instead @SouthwestAir give Dexter a raise I love him and now I would die for him
@SouthwestAir We ended up leaving about an hour and a half later.
@SouthwestAir Fun fact: currently sitting on a southwest flight. Fourth of the day, after two were so delayed that I had to take connecting routes. A list preferred again for 2020...but not looking likely for 2021.
@SouthwestAir called customer service 5 times in the last 2 hours.... still can’t get a representative &amp; they never called back after I “secured my place In line.” .... 👀
@SouthwestAir better get me a nice bed n’ breakfast with an uber
Beyond disappointed with the way @SouthwestAir handled &amp; treated us tonight when our flight was cancelled. Left stranded with no options or luggage. Might have to strongly reconsider them as our preferred airline. #disappointed #IThoughtSouthwestWasKnownForCustomerService
@SouthwestAir UNBELIEVABLE!! The audacity! Who expects an 80 year old woman to sit in a wheelchair for over 24 hrs in an airport! This is outrageous!
@SouthwestAir THIRD incident in 3 months! What happened to “The mission of Southwest Airlines is dedication to the highest quality of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and Company Spirit."?
@SouthwestAir I’ve been on hold for 15 minutes now and all I need is my confirmation number that was supposed to arrive via email and never did. Help!
You know when someone didn’t do their job right when it comes to claiming a bag and @SouthwestAir lost my bag. It’s perfect late Christmas gift and 200 voucher won’t do a trick, it’s a pathetic way to excuse your poor performance. I will not fly with you guys again. Smh
Really SUPER love that the only reason I know it was cancelled is because I’m physically with the person @SouthwestAir sent the cancellation text to??? like y’all was I just on my own to figure it out when I woke up at 4am??? where’s the flight update email at??
@SouthwestAir I am extremely disappointed with you all! I cannot believe that you would expect an 80 year old woman to sit in a wheel chair for over 24 hrs because you cannot de- ice the plane. What kind of employee would make such a ridiculous decision!
@SouthwestAir this customer service is not good, I am very disappointed!!
If my next flight gets cancelled... I swear to God @SouthwestAir
Hey @SouthwestAir what’s going on in Chicago? You just canceled my kids flight (16&amp;12) &amp; rebooked them on the 1st? Are you kidding me right now? No luggage and stranded for 2 days??
@SouthwestAir Thanks for getting me home! As I told my boss, I’m pretty meh about the delays, just wanted to sleep in my own house.
Hey @SouthwestAir horrible customer service how the cancellation of Flight 30 from BWI to PHX was handled in-house Sunday night! It will be a very long time before we fly you again
@SouthwestAir this is the second time in a row this year y’all have lost my bags. And to think I was gonna finally apply for a southwest card. Tuh... not happening now!
We’ve finally landed but can’t get off because they are asking for a power cord before turning off the engine or something. Goodness @SouthwestAir come onnnn. To be so delayed both ways- neither time for weather (meaning in your control) is tiring
@SouthwestAir Awesome, here is my rapid rewards number 😉 RR# 20103306856
Somebody at @SouthwestAir is paying to have my luggage replaced. HOW IS THERE AN ENTIRE WHEEL MISSING?!
@SouthwestAir hey flight 2142 from oak to lgb hasn’t taken off. We’re sitting in the plane at our gate still. We’re getting zero info on board and we’ve been boarded for 45 minutes. What is going on!? Even they delay updates aren’t accurate on your app.
Hey @SouthwestAir - my flight is 3 hours delayed 😕 can you hook up some drink tickets or something?
My @SouthwestAir flight to Phoenix just got cancelled and now I am stuck at the airport🤦🏼‍♀️ My checked bag is going to make it to Phoenix before I do #annoyed
@SouthwestAir Just boarded 😭 but thanks for the tweet!
@SouthwestAir we’ve been sitting on the plane for 30 minutes and still have not departed for flight 2142 🙃
@SouthwestAir help. Put next flight is in 7 minutes but we are still on your other plane
When you were supposed to be ringing in 2020 in Disney but @SouthwestAir cancels your 6:30am flight at 11pm the night before with no explanation 🙃
Dear @SouthwestAir get my boyfriend back before our New Year’s Eve special date. The fact you cancelled as he was SITTING DOWN ON THE PLANE TONIGHT and told him the next available flight was 5pm the next day. Horrid customer service.
@SouthwestAir why haven't my DMs been answered?! My flight was cancelled TWICE today
@SouthwestAir but still incredibly disappointing. just one more data point to keep me frustrated that there's no clear winning airline out of dca!
@SouthwestAir not my flight, just trying to help a friend with 100 people in line ahead of her at MDW. :)
@SouthwestAir I booked a flight for my mother on new years day. Can I get the points for that
@SouthwestAir Can I bring my lightsaber I purchased at Disneyland as a carry-on, on the plane?
Wow @SouthwestAir apparently completely cancelled my mom's flight six hours before takeoff and is offering no help to rebook. Their website won't even show the flight status...
@SouthwestAir who do I contact about getting reimbursed for fees regarding a cancelled flight? Thanks in advance.
@SouthwestAir Now I'm sitting on a runway because my late arriving flight has no available gate to pull up to. Last I checked, the weather at DAL was clear. I wonder if this wait will exceed the 30 minute wait for my luggage #southwestdoesntcare
@SouthwestAir Stop being shit. You guys don’t serve drinks on the flight and the whole crew hid for 2.5+ hours of a 47 minute flight because they don’t like angry riders. You guys are trash. I’m switching my airlines because of it.
@SouthwestAir what’s the status of bags from flight 1327 that was cancelled. Need to grab my daughter from the airport and she needs her clothes. #flightcancelled
@SouthwestAir Jill via phone was #amazing #CustomerService
@SouthwestAir , after about an hour of being out in the rain at Midway, the bags were moved. What is the procedure of compensation if our luggage and it’s contents are damaged?
@SouthwestAir you can't help someone via phone when their connecting flight is cancelled bc the trip is in progress? that seems...inefficient.
@SouthwestAir disappointed with your customer service in Atlanta airport.
#tfw there's a cockroach on your @SouthwestAir flight 🤮
@SouthwestAir what are you, scared of a little snow to cancel the last flight 295 from houston to chicago? you have seen and handled so much worse. disappointed.
Everyone boo @SouthwestAir for taking over an hour to get our luggage off the aircraft - actually waited until the whole plane was empty to get the bags off
I fly @SouthwestAir so much I might as well work for them. What astonishes me is that I’ve never recognized a flight crew from a previous flight. I have a friend that’s a flight attendant too and have yet to see her in action. At least 100 flights over the past 2 years.
@SouthwestAir what’s up with the last minute MDW cancellations? Trying to get to SFO! Happened everytime I’ve flown in the last year! Not looking good!
@SouthwestAir We are stuck at Midway after our connection was cancelled. No one is working here. Where are our bags???
@SouthwestAir Got to the gate 25 minutes ago. Still waiting on a jetway driver at DAL...
Thanks @SouthwestAir for canceling two of my flights today. Especially happy that you canceled the second flight one minute prior to boarding. #keepingitclassy #southworst #payformyubers
sponsored by einstein bro’s bagels, stranded by @SouthwestAir and shitty chicago weather
Landed 12/27 to DCA on nonstop flight from MSY. Bag didn’t make it. @SouthwestAir told me to come back to airport 12/28, bag didn’t make it. They said they’d ship to vacation place &amp; it would arrive by 12/30. Didn’t arrive. Called today &amp; they said it’s out of their control. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Jessica even checked on me a couple minutes after I took the Dramamine to ask if I was okay. Y’all just don’t know how thankful I am that she saved me from throwing up and possibly humiliating myself. @SouthwestAir
So im just making it to Houston @SouthwestAir and i was suppose to be here since 6 o’clock
Very nice of @SouthwestAir to close half the customer service counters after canceling flights. We can’t even find out where our luggage is without waiting in an hr+ long line.
2 hours and counting, still delayed @SouthwestAir
So I’m stuck in Chicago! 😖 Connection flight got cancelled. @SouthwestAir idc what these ppl expect me to do!
@SouthwestAir My mom has been sitting on a plane in Pittsburgh for 3 hours waiting for “paperwork” for a scratch on the plane. What’s up with this?? Shouldn’t there be some compensation for this ridiculous inconvenience. I love Southwest but do better.
@SouthwestAir Plane is full &amp; ready to go but we’re sitting at the gate (flight 1171 to ISP) 25 minutes later because we’re waiting on someone’s luggage. Hey Southwest, some of us have lives and make plans according to our arrival time. This is ridiculous
@SouthwestAir I am experiencing the worst service ever from New Orleans to Houston Hobby. Extra 2 hours in airport with no offers of food and now takes almost an hour to get luggage in Hobby. #horribleservice #neverflySWA
Shoutout to @SouthwestAir cause all 45+ of those flights was with them. Their customer service is unmatched. They always took care of me when I was trying to catch a last minute flight and offered me water when I was out of breath running to the gate haha
I’ve been pretty lucky with flights being time, but I guess it finally caught up to me.... @SouthwestAir Flight 447 to #stl oh well, it happens. #delayed #Travel #flight #plane #Southwest #Weather #chicago
@SouthwestAir I don’t understand how you cancel a flight 10 minutes before it’s suppose to take off. You knew ahead of time prior to people coming to the airport that that flight wasn’t going to be made. I may have tk stsrt aking my money elsewhere
@SouthwestAir hello my bag, after being lost and delayed, arrived damaged. I reported the damage when the bag was delivered but have heard nothing back from southwest. I return to new zealand shortly. Happy to give you the reference number if you dm me
@SouthwestAir SUCK! LEFT MY BAG AGAIN! NEVER AGAIN
Something prettty exciting happened! As of today, I’ve achieved both A-list status AND companion pass status on @SouthwestAir! 👏🏻🙌🏻💪🏻 #loyalcustomer #frequentflyer #ipaidformyweddingonmysouthwestcreditcards 🤦🏼‍♀️😂👰🏼
@SouthwestAir Gate 124 at MCO was ready to depart on time until we’ve been standing lined up for 20 minutes... while we wait for someone to bring wheelchair(s) to get customers off the previous flight. And there went our on time departure...
Thanks for cancelling our flight ten minutes before we boarded @SouthwestAir you fucking scavenger of human misery
@SouthwestAir due to an issue with your website my booking didn't go through. Please help fix this.
@SouthwestAir can you guys start selling neck pillows and bring sprite back?
2 hours later, cancelled flight connections, a lady throws up on the plane, a miscommunication b/w the pilot and other staff, no communication or explanation given to the remaining passengers flying to ATL. Thanks a lot @SouthwestAir
One more win for the decade. My checked @SouthwestAir bag was 49 lbs.
@SouthwestAir looking forward to a great flight tomorrow!
@SouthwestAir Jill at your call center....reservations in #Phoenix #winning #great #flying
Baggage issues so far with @SouthwestAir 1st flight: two brand new bags with dents in them and 1 bags handle is now jammed. 2nd flight: one of the cup holders on our bag was ripped off. Baggage told us there was nothing they can do but “notate our account”
@SouthwestAir Trying to check in for my flight tomorrow- but getting message have to see airport agent so no boarding position. Flying on a companion pass out of PVR, companion was able to check in no issues. Is this common on international companion pass tickets?
Hey @SouthwestAir I’m in NOLA for two nights and y’all lose my luggage with all my clothes, toiletries, and antibiotics...thanks a lot.
@SouthwestAir you did not disappoint today! Thank you! 🛬 #Travel #NewYearsEveEve
@SouthwestAir - we have been waiting almost 40 minutes for our luggage and not one bag has come out. Why does it take this long?????
Southwest sent me free drink vouchers in the mail, no strings attached, for no obvious reason. Cheers to my favorite airline @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir In and out of uniform we are Soldiers Troops Airmen Marines etc.. however we do not always travel in uniform as it is even more dangerous to do so. Your regard and especially Kathleen R O L L A! disregard definitely showed how much appreciation there is for service members 🤷🏽‍♀️
@SouthwestAir Thanks for looking into this for me. I finally received my bags, but 49 minutes is ridiculous. I fly Southwest out of MSP every other week and the bag times are horrible. What’s the deal with MSP?
It would be nice if @SouthwestAir cared ONE IOTA about their handicapped customers. If u think I am simply complaining, try sitting (w/cancer &amp; crippling arthritis) with 10 other passengers in wheelchairs, being gawked at like cattle, with nobody to help you &amp; no one who cares.
@SouthwestAir Unfortunately that’s sad I hope you strongly reconsider military boarding procedures esp when in the same tweet you ensure you do appreciate someone’s service. Nevertheless the lack of professionalism and customer service was what caused frustration and disappointment
@SouthwestAir more like boycott you I say because you all violating Americans with disability act law a federal law and any state laws and giving me a bunch of runaround I’m no hamster on a wheel so fix it know
Great customer service by Linda @SouthwestAir for my Companion Pass setup and reservation! Much appreciated
I thought y’all said @SouthwestAir was decent. This is about to be my first and last time. The mf ghetto
@SouthwestAir Thank you for amazing customer service!!! Problem solved.
@SouthwestAir Hey Southwest every passenger on flight 2057 from STL are still waiting for bags.
@SouthwestAir this is totally unacceptable...... I’ve recently been a big fan of southwest until this flight.....
@SouthwestAir so I am currently seated on flight 2376. We boarded at 1900 and at 2000 we are still sitting at the gate. This has been the most uncomfortable hour of my life. It’s hot, several passengers need to use the bathroom. There is no communication about the status.......
@SouthwestAir Has flight 1211 from BDL to MDW taken off? SWA app says it departed at 8:12 but a text from my son, a passenger, indicates it is still on the ground. Please advise what is going on
@SouthwestAir I understand that delays happen but the lack of communication is really the most aggravating thing here. We haven’t heard an update from the pilot for about an hour and we are close to sitting on the plane for 2. I’ve been getting better updates from twitter and I’m on the plane
@SouthwestAir flight 2468 delayed from #PITtoDEN sarcastic comments by gate agents that Denver bound passengers are not getting compensated for our time don’t make the 2 hour delay any easier #customerservice #AListpreferred #flightdelay
@SouthwestAir We made it back to Houston from Las Vegas around 3:15am Friday morning. When we landed, You baggage team said their was no record of it being put on the plane. Today, they say it arrived at 3:31am on friday. I feel like I saw my mom's luggage behind mine. Idk if it was stolen or
@SouthwestAir FUCK YALL, thx for 100$
@SouthwestAir Hey Southwest flight 2057 from STL landed in MSP 25 minutes ago and I’m still waiting for the bags with everyone else who was on that flight. What’s up?
@SouthwestAir had a great flight crew today. They even left us a parting #NewYears thought: "there are still kind people in the world. If you don't know one, be one"
Fitting that my final flight of 2019 would be a - delayed several hours due to a winter storm b - from New Hampshire and c - what makes sure I hold onto my @SouthwestAir A List status for 2020.
Hey @SouthwestAir on flight 2468 delayed now 2+ hours. I sure hope we’re going to be compensated for sitting on the plane. #southwest #airline #customerservice #airlines #PITtoDEN
Christmas vacation with family. Makes me want to consider flying with someone else next time considering these flights arent cheap and i could not be verbally attacked by rude women while boarding my flight. Hope you can find more inviting kind workers next holiday @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir I love your airline but I don't understand why you send an empty plane out while making customers who are early wait two hours for their schedules flight or pay a $200 fare difference. Super frustrating!
Another delayed flight with @SouthwestAir #SHOCKER
@SouthwestAir Ive flown with yall since I was 5 by myself all the way to adult hood several times a year. I swear by this airline as being the best airline, but today was straight disrespectful. I have never been spoken too so by one of your employees in such a demeaning and...
@SouthwestAir Not only that, but we arrived late, at a gate that was on the other side of the terminal of my connecting flight and we did not get full drink service. I felt so rushed and upset.
@SouthwestAir why on earth am I watching my plane get deiced after I already boarded? Wouldn’t it make sense to do this as passengers depart and board to speed things along? Been sitting idle on the tarmac for 30 minutes now
@SouthwestAir i suppose to be in Houston right now and I’m still at MSY 🙄
@SouthwestAir Really just adding insult to injury to the fact that I had to pay close to $300 to change my cancelled flight from providence to be on this one to get back to Chicago tonight. Still don’t understand why BDL is not a co-terminal for PVD.
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the reply, but why did we board the aircraft then if we were just going to be sitting here for over an hour?
Love, love, love @SouthwestAir found a cheaper, later, direct flight Thursday night, to SFO instead of OAK. No change fees, a future credit on Southwest, and 2 more hours to play poker is a win-win-win.
even though my flight was delayed due to weather, @SouthwestAir really is on their A game 🙌🏼👏🏼 continuous updates and the most polite staff and crew 👏🏼 thank you!
@SouthwestAir SWA app says flight #1211 departed BDL for MDW. Plane is still on the ground. Please advise what is going on
.@SouthwestAir hey guys. I am having a really shitty experience today. I was involuntarily rebooked to a flight arriving 9 hours late and after enduring my unplanned 6 hour layover my 2nd flight has been delayed 45 mins b/c of a broken ticket scanner
@SouthwestAir to be clear, I have a TSA approved dog carrier
Someone just got kicked off my flight for having a fake / wrong ticket. How’d they get onto the gangplank @SouthwestAir ? #sjc #las #party
@SouthwestAir I am so pleased by the customer service I received. I literally had to call back to thank my service representative.
@SouthwestAir Still on ground. Is #1211 going to take off for MDW tonight?
@SouthwestAir this is poor customer service! Did everyone forget about the dog instance on United? I think we all learned that animals are important too!
@SouthwestAir I’m in an exit row and the flight attendant says that a gentleman with nice manners is not allowed to put my bag up for me. She says if he does this, I am not allowed to sit in the exit row. Which FAA regulation supports this? Discrimination bc I am petite female?
@SouthwestAir I was told I could put my dog in a middle or window seat in another row but return to my aisle seat. Would you leave your dog with strangers on a plane?
@SouthwestAir - I specifically paid for early bird check in so I could pick an aisle seat knowing I had my dog.
@SouthwestAir - I’m on flight 3195 from Chicago to Orlando and the male flight attendant told me I’m not allowed to have an aisle seat with my dog. Can you show me where it says that in your policy?
Haha so my plane was like 3 feet off the tarmac and then shot right back up without telling anyone what was going on and then a flight attendent made fun of us all for being terrified 🙃🙃 @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir what is the objective of your active duty military boarding policy? Is it to thank service members? If so, the vast majority of us are told not to fly in uniform. Or is it to put on a show? Either way, you should change it.
Is it the southwest app we need to download before trip so have wifi and movies on plane? @SouthwestAir
my flight keeps getting delayed I’m so sad ugh @SouthwestAir u never fail me like this :(
@SouthwestAir it’s insane that I’m the 21st century you can’t track a bag that YOU lost. This is your job, you should be able to find it and give it to us, or at least tell us where it is. #boycottingyou horrific service. We now have lost things we can never get back
@SouthwestAir disappointed in u. Trying to find our lost bag and u can’t give any information. U said it landed in NY last night and would be with us within 4 hrs. That was 12 hrs ago. My great aunt who passed away knitted sweaters for my nephew that are over 30 years in that bag
flying @SouthwestAir for the first time in years!! i am totally into the open seating plan 🤩
@SouthwestAir Renee on flight 886 today from SJD to LAX was a pure delight. I don’t want to only complain 😉
Love it when my flight is delayed after I’m already boarded. @SouthwestAir 😡😡😡
@SouthwestAir An hour and a half is more than a slight inconvenience.. I get that bags take a while sometimes but that's really bad.
@SouthwestAir You should NOT be sending a confirmation email for a price you have no intention to honor!! Your name is on the confirmation! YOURS!
I'm confused @SouthwestAir . My first flight I checked in exactly on time and got C50. Yet it was not a full flight and had an open seat next to me. My flight back I paid $25 got A50, and my gf did not pay, got A57 and it's full, no open seat next to me 🤔 What? #wasteofmoney
@SouthwestAir what happened to all the direct flights that used to be available? There are so few now if it’s more than a state over. Will they return when you get more planes back in the rotation?
And kudos to these @SouthwestAir pilots for the awesome flyover of the Cotton Bowl on the way into Love Field!
@SouthwestAir Liquid for MCT oil and then I have powdered supplements like protein powder
@SouthwestAir any way you all can help my wife with her rapid rewards last name update so it matches her drivers license? Need it to match in hopes of grabbing a limited quantity, Wanna Get Away ticket 🙏🏻
@SouthwestAir really needs to answer my call regarding a LOST ITEM
My fiancé loves @SouthwestAir and while I don’t hate them... I do HATE the no assigned seats. Currently standing line getting asked “what number are you?” That’s all caps baby, I do not enjoy this.
@SouthwestAir I'm from florida the sunshine state I'm on Louisiana where it is 57 not only did you guys lose my bag you lost 3 of my family members luggage and we are all freezing what can you do for me?
@SouthwestAir You sent me the confirmation with a price. Not them. I cannot reach anyone on any #. Including Southwest. Dont say your sorry about giving me one price so I would book through you when I get charged another. Are you trying to say you dont know what your promising??!!
Major shoutout to @SouthwestAir for again proving they are the best airline ever!! My layover was delayed so they put me on an earlier first flight, and then at my layover they moved me again to an even earlier layover flight!! Getting in 4.5 hrs before I was supposed to. THANKS!
@SouthwestAir Look Adrienne I cannot and will not have employees at corporate office violating Americans with dissability act law a federal law and any state laws and stop the b.s. and make it right and right know or don’t tweet me so my phone number 808-675-1654 ok
@SouthwestAir your baggage handling situation in Houston needs to be addressed. Luggage never got loaded on our way out and an hour for a carousel to be assigned on the way home. Ridiculous!
Super frustrating when all the passengers show up on time for their @SouthwestAir flight but the captain can’t....
@SouthwestAir The confirmation from Southwest should be what the rental company charges!! That's called Bait &amp; Switch and its ILLEGAL Adrienne! It wasn't just feedback. I could not get to speak to anyone in your " customer service" and you dont have customer service email!
Excited yo take my first flight to las vegas by @SouthwestAir
Just waited an hour and a half for baggage with the rest of our flight 1262 from Midway. Our time is more valuable than that. Our baggage wait was almost as long as our flight itself. @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir thanks for Roger at the service counter in Dallas. He is an asset for your company
Suggested I go to Walmart and buy a bigger carrier (won’t fit under seat) and come back. Walked over to @SouthwestAir terminal who booked me on next flight out to MDW WITH my dog no questions asked.
@SouthwestAir Can MCT oil be packed in a carryon or backpack along with my other powdered supplements?
@SouthwestAir Is flight #1211 from BDL to MDW still departing at 6:35 as per your app? No communication (nor boarding) at gate
@SouthwestAir Hey Victoria! We have not, because I have no clue where to go/what to do for that!
@SouthwestAir how are you going to have a conveyor belt break at FLL and then load the people in the plane without telling them....then land is New Orleans when over 50 people's bags do not show up at baggage claim say sorry your bags must have been left in FLL.
have never been more disgusted in my life. That’s perfectly fine if @SouthwestAir Southwest does not support its Troops and service members but it is never okay to disrespect or deny someone of at minimum proper customer service especially if that is the field in which you work.
@SouthwestAir I just had the ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDED AT YOUR TERMINAL B12 out of Seattle (SEA TAC AIRPORT) to Sacramento (SMF) by Kathleen Rolla! RUDEST person I have ever came across. Kathleen Rolla Poor customer service awardee 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
@SouthwestAir And I asked for assistance and got the”we don’t have a policy “ comment. If I say “ tough” and sit and take the saved seat, what then? Still no policy judgement?
Fuck you @SouthwestAir. Fuck you fuck you fuck you. Every fucking flight of yours is late. For no reason. Fuck you.
@SouthwestAir What about the abuse of a passenger upgrading only one in their party and saving three seats in an exit row? That’s crap
@SouthwestAir Can I pack an old VCR machine in carry-on luggage assuming the luggage size meets carry-on rules?
@SouthwestAir so, I have to say next time I fly I will be flying with you! My only “complaint” is this time we were able to get a Mid B group assignment but my dad and I were unable to sit together because the flight was full and everyone ahead of us chose and Aisle or Window🤷‍♂️
@SouthwestAir I would appreciate being compensated for this inconvenience with a drink coupon.
Bad #CustomerService @SouthwestAir ; cancelled flight, now stuck in Cincy airport overnight. No place to stay...nothing for the inconvenience
@SouthwestAir The flight actually ended up being moved back to the original time. Thank you for the response!
it took me over an hour to receive my bags last night at Oakland airport.. my wife had to wait over an hour in the cell phone lot while @SouthwestAir figured out where my luggage was. Very disappointed with the service.
@SouthwestAir I filled one out last night. I am hopeful an honest person found it! 🤞
Well today I was in the middle seat on my @SouthwestAir flight (this gets good). There was a 30 something white hipster man was sitting the aisle seat &amp; middle aged woman in the window seat. I was polite had my bag under my chair &amp; made sure my coat was
@SouthwestAir I just earned a companion pass for 2020 and I am flying with my companion on 1/1. Can I get those points back?
Stellar customer service from Dominika, at gate 17B (Southwest) on Monday, 12/30/19 in LAX. Thank you so much for being able to bump me to the earlier flight (since I arrived like 5 hours early lol) and ensuring my checked bags made it to the correct plane!!! I luv @SouthwestAir
To make clear my first tweet @SouthwestAir please just get my luggage back to me.
@SouthwestAir On our way home to MDW via OAK with kids. 6:50pm is delayed 2+hrs. Is there any way u can get us on the 4:50? We have 2 families total of 9. We land in OAK at 4:15pm
@SouthwestAir if I have the SW priority CC and I use an upgraded boarding but have a layover does it give me upgraded boarding for both flights or just one? (EX if I was flying Philadelphia to California with a layover in Denver).
Will never fly @SouthwestAir again... always tried to book southwest whenever possible for their customer service, but today their customer service lost a loyal customer. And they do not care.
@SouthwestAir I fly no other airline &amp; have not had my luggage lost. Now it’s happened &amp; I have not received an update when it was shared that it would fly in late last night/early morning. Some very important belongings in my luggage.
Had a great flight with @SouthwestAir ...and then my brother left his powerbeats pro charging case in his seat. 🙃🤷‍♀️
@SouthwestAir How long does it take for the app to update with flight delays? Google Assist told me a half hour ago my flight was delayed and the SW app hasn't updated yet.
@SouthwestAir If it’s open it’s yours is what they always say
@SouthwestAir You didn’t provide reasonable service when you had the chance last flight and now this is even worse. Your apologies are empty. Don’t give them to me if you don’t mean it
@SouthwestAir You can blame it on mother nature all you want, y'all figure that out... But one of y'all def owes me a vacation day!!! I was supposed to be home by 10am, it's almost 5pm and I haven't even boarded from my layover yet. 😫😩😦 #WorstTravelDayEver
@SouthwestAir Excited to see how the car seat comes back to us. I’ve sent these items dozens of times as checked items. Never a complaint. And today no one seemed to care about a little boy’s stuff or safety.
@SouthwestAir Should also mention that it took 3 people to pry the stroller back to somewhat normal so we could wheel our 2 year old to the car and put him in the out of safety standards car seat they gave us.
Every other airline allows for one other passenger to board with you, regardless of family affiliation. Why is this STILL not a thing with @SouthwestAir ?
@SouthwestAir open seating should mean open seating! Guess it’s ok to save seats now eh- would of liked to sit by my husband.
@SouthwestAir Nope. Told you are “not liable” for that. I get if it’s a small dent, ding, etc. But bent in half? How does a metal frame bend in half?
@SouthwestAir Your apology means nothing when I’m out nearly $1000 and stuck in NY. How are you delivering any type of customer service when you can manage to deliver a reasonable travel experience for either of my flights so far? How should i even trust tomorrow will go smoothly?
@SouthwestAir ten percent chance of snow does not affect a flight. You have flown me out of Denver when it was the worst snow storm in ten years. So you’re expecting me to cover the hotel in NY that i had to book day of, the Airbnb im not at, and possibly the show ill miss because of this?
@SouthwestAir 2 hour delay, will miss my sisters wedding, and gate agent says no compensation until its a 3 hour delay.
This is why I fly @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir i am usually pleased with your customer service but this is not what i expect from you guys at all to be in no way compensated and put on a flight the next day with zero explanation until i called and was on the phone for an hour and a half
@SouthwestAir so open seat policy means someone can save a seat and prevent someone from taking the seat they want?
@SouthwestAir i just had to find a new hotel in NY for the night and waste my Airbnb in Louisville that cost me $600
@SouthwestAir There is a 10% PERCENT chance of snow in Chicago at 10pm zero reason to cancel a flight. unacceptable that this is my second flight problem in a row with you. We use you for business and personal trips. Should i recommend my company change their airline for business use too!
VERY disappointed in @SouthwestAir. Checked a very nice stroller that worked fine, only to get it back bent in half. “Customer service” rep made my wife cry then informed her that the car seat was also lost. Not acceptable and out of character for Southwest. Needs to be fixed.
Down to the wire but I’ve earned my @SouthwestAir Companion Pass for 2020. Can’t wait to see what adventures are ahead! #travel #lifeofyes
@SouthwestAir my flight has been delayed literally 6 times today and my layover changed from 1 hour to 6 hours!! This is outrageous
@SouthwestAir your Twitter game is worse than your customer service at the airport
Not only did @SouthwestAir cause me to re-route, but my new flight has me boarding in group C and I’m totally going to be stuck in a middle seat.
@SouthwestAir The other flights will get us there even later
Hey @SouthwestAir would LOVE to know why the front wheel of my luggage is missing. If I have to do my job correctly shouldn’t your employees have to as well?
@SouthwestAir There wasn’t anyone today. No worries. Randomly saw a neon green bag that was mine. Thank you!
Our @SouthwestAir flight was delayed because of a mechanical issue, so we changed to a new flight (for free). Then a new aircraft for our original flight was found. They let us change back to our original flight and original boarding positions (for free). I love Southwest!
@SouthwestAir an update goes a long way with why we are just sitting here at the gate on an already delayed flight. #customerservice
Welp, made it to Denver... but my checked bag never left San Jose 😃 waiting for @SouthwestAir to delivery my bag, hopefully before the end of the year 🤪
@SouthwestAir my flight is now over 1 hour delayed and seems like im going to miss my sisters wedding
@SouthwestAir Be careful flying SWA...they told us 24 hours before our return flight that our flight canceled due to super max being grounded...then used weather as excuse 3 days later!! Lies lies lies!!
@SouthwestAir Yes, getting my luggage sent to my house instead of having me go and pick it up at the airport during rush hour.
@SouthwestAir have a quick question about luggage that I sent a DM
So, I have never considered @SouthwestAir before, mostly because they don't show up in most searches. My only fear is, this cheap flight means the dumbass behind me will take off their shoes and shove them on my armrest.
@SouthwestAir Hi Jeni. This isn’t in regards to luggage. After landing, we were stuck on the plane for an hour with the fasten seatbelt on! We landed at 11:40p and couldn’t get off until 12:30a.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the reply, Steve. This was definitely an outlier in our experience as SW customers. Bags made it onto the plane so I'm relieved!
Another day, another delayed flight courtesy of @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir power can go to your employees heads and common sense would say since we were sitting together boarding position makes little difference. Frustrating experience when you politely explain to her that you’re sitting with your partner
@SouthwestAir since when does being 5 ft tall mean you have to give your exit row seat up to a “Tall” person! Or is it because of being female? When you pay for priority boarding and sit in the exit row why should you be asked to move because your “short”
@SouthwestAir disappointing gate agent experience today while boarding. GF was B17 and I was B34. Attempted to board with GF as we sat together gate agent told me I need to wait my turn. others after our number went ahead of us didn’t feel the need to hold them back
Shoutout to the first officer on flight 3558 Dal to SD 12/29 @SouthwestAir for locating my IPad left in the TSA bin. 😀👍😍
Waiting on hold with @SouthwestAir for the 3rd time today, STILL no bag! This is wild! My experience, and the inconvenience of it all ain’t even worth the value of one of their flights. This is how they manage error. #MondayMood
@SouthwestAir I hope. I told the lady I understood they can’t control the weather but she clearly thought I was stupid with the way she was speaking to me
I can't remember the last time a @SouthwestAir flight left on time. Now, my flight 1996 is already over 30 minutes late . Just sitting here, hot on the plane. Turn on AC, please.
@SouthwestAir We did! You’ve been updating us but no luck. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir Not anymore SWA. Worst fly 2700.
@SouthwestAir Had the best customer service today! I think her name was Monica, she gets a gold star 🌟
So frustrated with @SouthwestAir left iPad with b-card on flight home MSP to STL. iPad was collected by SW lost and found. They noted the Washington University business card-did not call. Attempted to pick up STL &lt;17hr post landing, but It shipped it off.
@SouthwestAir Hey Southwest flight 2393 to STL from ATL has 17 pre-board passengers. Why isn’t there more help to board? Why not start boarding 45 minutes prior to departing?
Hey @SouthwestAir I’m not thrilled that my flight was cancelled and in the rebooking I ended up with like the worst seat placement. I went from a good one to one of the last. No meal or even drink ticket to accommodate.
@SouthwestAir told us you could in no way compensate us. UNACCEPTABLE. I may actually be done now
@SouthwestAir really sucks that i fly southwest for every flight and now my second flight in a row with you was rescheduled for tomorrow after i already paid for a $600 Airbnb in Louisville and won’t be there for two day’s of it. Now have to find an Airbnb in NY day of and you
Hi @SouthwestAir! I sent a private message about one of my flights last night and I haven’t received a response. Would someone be able to assist me?
Never flying with @SouthwestAir again. There’s no reason I should have to wait hours to get my luggage back after my claim. Disappointed
@SouthwestAir Any questions please ask or call me you all have my cell number ok
@SouthwestAir What is the status of flight 2354 from Denver to las vegas
@SouthwestAir Free flights on February 21 reservation codes R2O2DJ &amp; R37V9A and refund my credit card ok
@SouthwestAir Now to set an alert to watch out for the return flight low fare deals!!! 🤗
@SouthwestAir Understood. I’m pretty sure that a plane waiting for a gate for 45 minutes causes a domino effect in delays as well.I know your logistics people have a lot of variables to consider. Thanks for all the times things do go right.
@SouthwestAir any idea why flight 3794 (OAK-HOU) is delayed?
@SouthwestAir Jeni - thank you for taking care of us and for following up!
Hello @SouthwestAir ! I’m looking for an item I may have left on my flight this morning, who do I contact about that? Thanks!
To anyone that may have found our camera on Southwest flight #3404 from Omaha to Phoenix (continuing service to El Paso), PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider contacting me to be able to return it or at least return the SD card with all of our family Christmas pictures!! @SouthwestAir
.@SouthwestAir just got to the gate and they stopped an inch too early and shut down so we have to be towed. Vouchers for this bananas experience, please.
@SouthwestAir can you please give me an ETA on my luggage?
@SouthwestAir Hi Mariam, of course we know the traditional way of getting a pass. I’m asking if there will be any special companion pass offers coming up soon that don’t require 100 flights and 110k points? Or for first time pass holders etc
@SouthwestAir First world problem. Found a gate, but am curious why this happened.
.@SouthwestAir totaling 90 minutes and counting of sitting on aircrafts on active jetways for this flight after being completely boarded between take off and this landing.
Three @SouthwestAir flights in ten days and not one has left on time #losingtheiredge
My 7pm @SouthwestAir flight is ALREADY delayed. The only reason I don’t like evening flights is because of this domino effect .. some earlier flight doesn’t have it together so now you are hours later affected. This happened to me a week ago on my way home too 😒
.@SouthwestAir also baggage drop off opened late this morning. I’ve been disappointed in my overall day. Not the airline I’m used to.
.@SouthwestAir we also sat for over 45 minutes after boarding before take off. All of these babies (including mine) have been great but it’s time to get off please update us.
.@SouthwestAir I’ve been on flight 464 on the ground for almost a half an hour with no update about the time we will get to a gate. Update?
@SouthwestAir definitely my last time flying southwest and I would never recommend it to anyone either.
@SouthwestAir is a terrible airline. I had the worst experience and their customer service reps are also terrible.
I will never fly @SouthwestAir ever again.
@SouthwestAir And here I was hoping for an earlier boarding position 😩
@SouthwestAir, can somebody explain to me why your gate agent felt it appropriate to berate my 15 y/o daughter, traveling alone on a layover, for doing what she was instructed to do by your check-in agent? Is this how we treat children without their parents around?
@SouthwestAir told me that there is a "mutual responsibility" to know when there is a gate change. It appears that Southwest doesn't know good customer service anymore
@SouthwestAir No, didn’t know what route to take. Can I file a claim through you?!
If you flew @SouthwestAir on or shortly after 12/23 and found a kid’s sketchbook kit that says SPACE and has an outline of the Space Shuttle on the cover and you decided to go ahead and keep it even tho there was a child’s drawing and writing inside, that sucks.
@SouthwestAir Flying to Las Vegas this Friday, no one better than Southwest Airlines, a first class airline no matter what seat you are sitting in. ❤ you guys!
Current status: @SouthwestAir is telling me that they won't pay for my rental car - even though they gave me the incorrect info and bumped me from my seat.
@SouthwestAir will there be a companion pass offer soon? Early 2020? Die hard fans are patiently waiting. My pass expired 😥
@SouthwestAir MY SUITCASE WAS SLAUGHTER FROM LAST NIGHTS FLIGHT! OMG! It’s ruined and now smelling like mildew. Seems like it was left out in the rain! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
@SouthwestAir Then that’s something you need to acknowledge while a guest is purchasing a ticket. If I wanted to sit away from my partner I would’ve flown United Basic Economy. Never again will you get my money.
@SouthwestAir Hello, my daughter is flying right now and just had the worst experience ever on SW Airline's. She is flying from San Antonio to Orlando. I would like to talk to someone from SW. Please contact me
Yall @SouthwestAir just announced about the double rainbow here 😍🌈
@SouthwestAir I’m not complaining but not being able to use my 2 drink coupons from my business select flight today. Turbulence. I get it! Should be allowed to use on another flight another day.
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Cant wait to get back home!
@SouthwestAir Flight KO9DKM delayed by over two hours with no reason as to why, to then be boarded and separated from my partner who suffers from anxiety and hasn’t flown in a decade with ZERO concern from your cabin crew. shameful and now we’re sitting separately on our 1st flight together.
hi @SouthwestAir - leaving midway at 4 to Houston...how's it looking?
@SouthwestAir just enrolled with your mid tier credit card. Since points reset on January, will I start at zero again? Also, are the chase southwest card points different from general southwest points? How do I see the connection between both accounts?
@SouthwestAir bumped me from my seat today. Ask me if I'm flying Southwest again.
I’m on an @SouthwestAir fight , so you know what that means….yep…dealing with the absolute worst infight wifi. How many years have they been promising they’re upgrading this system?
I will never fly @SouthwestAir ever again. What a JOKE.
@SouthwestAir There wasn’t any miscommunication, it was a straight lie by one of your employees to fleece me of my hard earned money
@SouthwestAir What’s good guys. I’ve got a 5:45 flight from cleveland to midway that lands at 6:10 tonight. Noticed the travel advisory on your website and other flights that time getting cancelled. Ofc you guys can’t predict this, but think I’m looking at a delay/cancellation?
#firstworldproblems when @SouthwestAir doesn't have bag drop available and doesn't tend to the A-list lane at #memphis airport, then lectures you that your bag is late checked because you had to wait in the slowest longest bag check line #SouthwestAirlines 😖
@SouthwestAir Trying to get to Las Vegas to ring in the new year. Flight delayed! Booooo!! Not happy! ☹️😒
@SouthwestAir I know many mentions are negative and aggravated but I wanted to praise you all for your exceptional customer service and overall operations as an airline! I fly Southwest often and am always pleased. You all do a great job. Thank you!!
@SouthwestAir Integrity? When I bought the upgrade the person who helped said she didn’t need it and could board with me, then proceeded to lie to the gate attendant. Even had a complete stranger who heard the conversation call the liar out.
@SouthwestAir is there anyway i can catch a earlier flight. My flight is delayed by 35 mins. Pretty please
@SouthwestAir is the worst airline ever, won’t let my 9 year daughter board with me because I have A5 and she has a B pass. Epic fail, never flying with you again.
@SouthwestAir Confirmation # OFG23X We’re stranded.
@SouthwestAir Can I print out a copy so I can remember my number?
@SouthwestAir is tripping dude 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 I just wanna get back to LA. wtf
@SouthwestAir My Rapid Rewards card is broken. It's at least 15 years old. How can I order a new one? Can't see how to do it online.
@SouthwestAir Cool. But I need many of the things in my bag like now. So what’s the compensation for this?
I hate complaining, but have to when it’s out of control. Waiting an hour for our bags at the carousel? What in the world happened! Not right. I’m exhausted. (Flight details: ATL -&gt; LGA @SouthwestAir Flight 627)
Hey @SouthwestAir! My Mom and Dad have had to cancel trips from PHX ➡️MDW twice since my Mom got pneumonia. They have #WannaGetAway fares...can they transfer them to my brother or I so we can get to them (since we're healthy!)?
@SouthwestAir Yep. He actually told me that my luggage wasn’t coming up in the system. But I’ll get a call if you all find it and get it here..
@SouthwestAir Shout-out to your baggage services guy Ethan at JAX, busting his butt as the ONLY baggage guy for SW trying to clean up a mess your Baltimore folks made on a transfer from MHT.
man @SouthwestAir ... 6 hrs of flight time on the same plane, no drink service the last 4 hour leg and no wifi the last 4 hours. Kind of rough! Wonder when SW is gonna start adding plugs to their seats like everybody else? 🤔
@SouthwestAir love you guys but while unpacking my suitcase today I noticed my bag is broken from our flight yesterday. Any help?
@SouthwestAir Well Steve now we’re stuck in Denver with absolutely zero flights available to get home.
@SouthwestAir I’ve sent all of the details via DM. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir Hi team! Trying to get Companion Pass and wanted to know if a) points from RocketMiles hotel stays are tier qualifying, and if so b) do those points post to the account immediately after the stay is complete?
@SouthwestAir question: will purchases made before 1/1 still count towards my 2019 points for companion pass—even if my RR credit card statement doesn’t close until 1/21? As of today I’m at 109,049 but I’m unclear about the Dec purchases that occur between 12/21 &amp; 12/31.
@SouthwestAir Do you anticipate all flights to Chicago this evening will be canceled eventually?
It is interesting how @SouthwestAir tells us that the destination airport has too many planes at the airport and delays our take off by 50 minutes due to their bad planning. #southwest
@SouthwestAir I don’t understand why no one can get me information regarding my bag.
@SouthwestAir It’s a silver Henri Bendel bag
@SouthwestAir I need you to figure out what happened to my luggage!!!
@SouthwestAir Just booked. Entered wrong bday. Please help.
@SouthwestAir Why is no one in the Atlanta Baggage Service not answering the phone or calling me back about my lost/delayed bag?
@SouthwestAir i cannot overstate how incredibly helpful and patient she was -- i have a small speech impediment hampered by wearing braces, AND the reception was spotty -- we are incredibly, incredibly happy and needless to say we fly southwest whenever possible for this exact reason
@SouthwestAir Shelley at the San Jose Baggage Claim Phone Line helped us to recover my brother's phone lost on a plane on our first time to Texas -- she stayed with us late on Thursday night in and out of reception in Big Bend national park -- now we'll have it by new year's!!!
Tying to get back home to #Stl from NY. Flight got canceled but was able to easily rebook on a *blink* earlier flight. Thanks @SouthwestAir for making it easy so I can be home for NYE!
@SouthwestAir Every other person in the airport is doing so...was trying to connect direct for assistance🤷🏼‍♀️
I’m 3 for 3 this month on my flights being cancelled due to weather hahaha @SouthwestAir do you give awards out for that kind of perfection?! #newplan #istillloveSW #badtimingweather
@SouthwestAir last night my son had a 4hr flight to Denver and was flying alone. The attendants and pilots on his flight were amazing! They let him see the cockpit and sent me a picture of him! This put my heart at ease knowing they truly cared about my son! BRAVO SOUTHWEST!
@SouthwestAir Yes, at BWI sitting at Gate B12
@SouthwestAir it makes no sense that BDL is not a co-airport when cancellations happen at PVD. I was told that Manchester NH (MHT) and BOS were my only options. MHT is 105 miles from PVD and BDL is 96 miles away. How are these locations determined?
@SouthwestAir Sure! It’s 66255571, Julia Osborne Pikelny or Osborne-Pikelny
@SouthwestAir Was it due to weather in Chicago or providence?
@SouthwestAir Any thoughts or help for those of us out here who are 10,000 miles short for companion mile status? Quick purchases, or Southwest magic? Thnx
Currently stuck in BWI trying to get to Nashvegas for New Years. Hey @SouthwestAir Help ya girl out and let her get a standby on the 12:25! 😬 #NonstopOrBust #TravelBlues
@SouthwestAir I was more referring to being upset after I was given a hard time on the flight for my ESA dog’s carrier, and then later seeing one of the customer reps yell at multiple customers after we waited 1.5 hours for our bags, but thanks for the quick reply.
@SouthwestAir Allow me to explain, you have no available direct flights to my destination for the next 3 days and your refund would only cover about 1/6th of a new flight with a different airline. I have had these travel plans for months and you put me in this predicament the day of.
@SouthwestAir Hey Southwest! Luv the free standby procedure for A listers! You saved us 4 hours &amp; $200 plus each last weekend &amp; got us home early! So now I’ve got A list preferred... with dedicated phone number for you? How do I find?
@SouthwestAir Why was flight 575, PVD-MDW canceled today?
@SouthwestAir Thank you so much for the amazing service, you were able to resolve our issue! #HappyCustomers
@SouthwestAir I sent a dm, thank you.
@SouthwestAir I appreciate the generic response, when I was finally put through with a customer service agent after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were absolutely no help in regard to getting me to my destination in a timely manner.
@SouthwestAir No worries. It’s not your fault. I just blame the weather
@SouthwestAir Thank you. We are hoping too.
@SouthwestAir I know Y’all love Texas, too! I would love to go on a Texas food tour with y’all. Pretty please!
@SouthwestAir Jamaica Montego traffic is horrible .. praying we make the 12:30 flight
Horrible job by @SouthwestAir this morning in New Orleans. Completely understaffed, causing a late check in A list, and now no bags till 4pm in Fort Lauderdale...arrived over an hour before my flight. Not acceptable...
@SouthwestAir No, this is my child ha. Our luggage is damaged after a southwest flight late last night. What can we do?
@SouthwestAir Cancelled my flight last minute today and has made no effort to make any accommodations. I will never be flying this airline again and neither should you!
@SouthwestAir So why are we 30 mins late on 1428 at SJC because of passengers who didn’t get to the airport early! #fail
Another @SouthwestAir flight, another delay. And this time it’s the aircraft/crew’s first leg of the day. ZERO excuse for this.
Shoutout to the @SouthwestAir crew on our flight from Baltimore to Nassau....passing out customs sheets as we boarded the plane! #efficiency
@SouthwestAir Thank you! Yes, we were able to watch our beloved Sooners lose all during our flights. Sorry to those who heard me holler a few times. Rough game! Thanks!
@SouthwestAir Cool so my travel plans are subjected to hitting the refresh button. Just awesome. What stellar service. This flight is the ONLY one y’all cancelled like what the heck y’all. There’s really no flight you can put me on?? Please slide into DMs if you would like.
@SouthwestAir baggage strikes again. We didn’t have luggage for half the trip home because they got lost for several days as previously mentioned, then now on our return flight, we get home and everything in our luggage is totally soaked. I can ring water out of my clothes. 😤
I’ll have the omelette and bacon please... @SouthwestAir first-class #Seat1F 🤣
@SouthwestAir are there perks to flying on your birthday as a RR member?
@SouthwestAir Ok thank you. I just thought drink vouchers accumulate more
@SouthwestAir I do please. We got in very late last night to damaged luggage. We have another bag’s wheel which isn’t great either. My daughters bag though, doesn’t roll at all.
@SouthwestAir It would be really great if your web site and/or app supported searching multiple cities when booking (both origin and destination). I'm often looking for schedule, direct vs connection, etc and flexible on exact airport (OAK vs SJC)
@SouthwestAir ya y’all make my life harder than it needs to be
@SouthwestAir Have a no seat saving policy. Inly acceptable remedy
@SouthwestAir, thanks for having a great team in Las Vegas including Veronica! She’s a customer service rock star!
@SouthwestAir well that’s great and all but how exactly do you expect to “get me going” if your flights for the next two days are sold out??
@SouthwestAir I’ll dm my number. I’m glad you treat me better than my mom Steve!!
@SouthwestAir EB a waste when SW allows seat saving
This has been the worst flight experience I’ve had in a long time. I don’t think I’m flying @SouthwestAir again. 😡
@SouthwestAir We took that advice and still ended up in this situation.
@SouthwestAir Lack if seat saving policy creates problems on flights. Money paid for early bird wasted when someone saves a seat for a C passenger
@SouthwestAir I tried to rebook and all your flights are booked for the next two days. The only thing that’ll make me more angry than I am right now Is if I go to MSP to try and fly standby and have nothing to show for it.
@SouthwestAir is there anyway we can exchange our drink coupons for free Wifi instead? It would be great if we could select either or...🤔
@SouthwestAir is usually my airline of choice, but they just cancelled my flight with NO explanation and no other rebooking options for 2 days... why isn’t this anywhere in the news if all their flights are cancelled?! Happy new year to me... #neveragain
@SouthwestAir my sister has gotten free drink coupons multiple times and I fly 4x more than her on southwest. My mom already has favoritism towards her, why you too?
@SouthwestAir The flight is Wednesday. I booked it today.
@SouthwestAir Sure, I just sent the message.
@SouthwestAir Oh I have, with help from your employee who seemed more interested in the conversation they were having with someone else while on the phone with me! Have a great day and pray that I don’t get written up for missing work!!! 🤪
@SouthwestAir stinks. Cancel my daughters flight then charge me more points to get her home
@SouthwestAir I have reservations and money that is being wasted.
@SouthwestAir Super frustrated to arrive to the ATL airport this morning with ample time to check my bag and board my plane but due to the lack of staff to accommodate the busiest airport in the world, I waited in TWO 45 minute lines only to miss the flight and be put on standby.
Thank you @SouthwestAir for ruining my entire day🥰🥰
@SouthwestAir and no, don’t give me a voucher or a coupon for your airline — I plan to avoid your airline like the plague. You always delay or cancel flights and heavily inconvenience people. I would happily take a reimbursement to the card I used to pay for my flight. KThnx.
Second flight by @SouthwestAir cancelled in a week! 😄
Dang @SouthwestAir, I’m really disappointed in your operation today. You San Jose crew can learn a lot from the Orlando team.
@SouthwestAir is the WORST airline! It’s a cloudy day and they use that as a reason to cancel my flight! I HAVE to be back in NY tomorrow evening but of course they have no other flights. Now I had to pay to use a totally different airline. Hey #Southwest wanna reimburse me?
@SouthwestAir You should at least add that verbiage to your site/app. I'm not debating your policy. But it would have been helpful to have that information visible as one is attempting to do so.
@SouthwestAir booked a ticket for my sister due to family emergency and accidentally used her maiden name. What can I do?
@SouthwestAir disappointed to be delayed multiple times on #1701 causing me to get home at 2:45am. Missed my ride home, had to Uber instead. 👎👎.
@SouthwestAir Yep- perhaps send Wi-Fi coupons along with the drink coupons! Thanks!
Good morning @SouthwestAir ! Genuine question here: what’s the point of entering my RR# every time I buy Wi-Fi inflight if you don’t reward me with promo codes or vouchers? I buy for *three* devices at $8 each at least once a month.
@SouthwestAir Already checked in but no longer able to fly today. Can you help?
I wake up at 8am to a text from @SouthwestAir that was sent at 7:39am saying my flight was canceled and I needed to rebook. I’m extremely confused because the weather doesn’t seem bad 🤷🏾‍♀️ So i go, look to rebook, find one that’s decent and then...
I usually don’t get upset with @SouthwestAir but they got me alllll the way messed up. I checked in for my flight yesterday, on time. Had a GREAT position to board. A.
@SouthwestAir I'm good. Thanks anyway ✌🏾
PART TWO OF THE SAGA: my flight back to Chicago was cancelled and now I get to search for new airport rides and pack up quicker than planned as well as not seeing my mother/grandmother to say bye. Thanks @SouthwestAir
Trying to add @SouthwestAir Early Bird Checkin for my flight tomorrow evening the app won't let me. Whatever I'll save my money and set an alarm. Just read that doesn't even guarantee an A spot anyway. Been saying I need a new go-to airline anyway. Now's the time. #2020goals
@SouthwestAir Anyone available at your Dallas office? Calling Dallas office...no one's answering...keep saying "Someone will be with you as soon as possible"...will it be before the end of the year?
@SouthwestAir She made it- it they had to open the door for her😖TSA be damned! 🤣
@SouthwestAir flight was supposed to be at 6:20 and over two hours later we still haven’t boarded. I didn’t get up at 4am for this.
Missed my flight but shoutout to @SouthwestAir for getting me on the next available flight no charge y’all the MVPs for real!
it’s a lovely morning flying @SouthwestAir this morning. their flight attendants are always so nice. ♥️ now i wait for my connecting flight in dallas
I think it’s WILD that @SouthwestAir is charging an arm and a leg for flights to JA for Independence Day. I’m just tryna go see my Daddy 🙄😭
@SouthwestAir Any way to let the flight know? That she’s stuck in security? 5:45 to midway. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir Thanks Heather- my daughter is having a little panic attack 😖hoping for the best
@SouthwestAir Any way to light tsa up here to open more lanes?🙏🏻
@SouthwestAir Well, Steve, I missed my flight due to this 1 1/2 hour long line. How about some tix for me and my fam to help us get over this experience?
@SouthwestAir Looks like less than half of the lanes open here
@SouthwestAir Thank you! Hope my daughter didn’t miss her flight to midway this am 😳
Hey @SouthwestAir why is there only 1 person working your full service counter at this hour? This line stretches across Ontario
@SouthwestAir tsa at mccarran is making everyone late this morning! Can you get them to open more gates? It’s the checkpoint near ticketing - you are going to have a lot of late passengers
Alright @SouthwestAir I know it’s not y’all fault that I’m mentally handicapped but please let me swap my flight. The patriots dumbass just had to lose to the dolphins. Let’s work together on this.
I love @SouthwestAir so damn much. Y’all are always so pleasant and welcoming, and the personality of your crew jumps out every time!
To the @SouthwestAir copywriter who came up with "Two bags for the price of none"--I love you.
TRYING to understand that this flight crew can't control that another plane blocked us in on @SouthwestAir .. but I ain't been home in 10 days and this 6am flight NEEDS to take off. 😩. I WANT MY BED.
@SouthwestAir I didn’t notice it until I got home and unpacked my suitcase. It was the water damage that ruined the book. Everything was mildly wet but most of it is fine bc they were clothes or toiletries. So I need to contact Hobby? Or the Austin office since that’s my destination?
Hey so question for @SouthwestAir been sitting sitting on the tarmac so long I'm curious when rent is due.
@SouthwestAir No we went to your representative at JFK and were told that this wasn’t covered. I think that is pretty ridiculous considering you broke it. We’ve been spending all day and night looking for a replacement as a result since we urgently need it!
@SouthwestAir Okay wonderful! Thank you for your speedy reply and kindness! 💕
@SouthwestAir Thank you Heather! You’re so sweet! Isn’t it true that we are allowed to get in order even if we arrive a little later?
@SouthwestAir I also told her that I hoped she had a great day and that I loved her bag! I guess she didn’t want to show me her bag in the picture. 😭 Also I loved her eyelashes! She was very pretty.
I have a fav airline now which is @SouthwestAir ❤️
@SouthwestAir Cancelled flight on HOU-DAL day trip. Cassandra, outstanding ticket agent in HOU, got me out on the next flight and rebooked my return. Need some of those “thx for kicking tail coupons” Customer service like this is why #iflyswa
@SouthwestAir What’s the point in getting to the airport early if there’s no one at the check in desk and the self service kiosks are offline???? I always fly southwest specifically to avoid this. #irritated #SFO
@SouthwestAir is paging last call for an Orlando flight. 😭 #takemewithyou
The true heroes of @SouthwestAir throughout this whole mess were the gate agents. They were cheerful, helpful, and sympathetic even when some of us were having a hard time. :-)
2 Flights booked for 2020 🔥🔥🔥 @SouthwestAir I need some drink vouchers please ❤️
@SouthwestAir Well our luggage came out fast at least! We were on flight 798 from Phoenix to OAK - the flight crew told all of the passengers over intercom to “take it up with management”
@SouthwestAir - BIG shoutout to two flight attendants on my flight yesterday (#5435 - tul-las). Ro &amp; Linda were the most efficient/friendly SW flight attendants I’ve EVER had on my flights. I fly 15-20 times a yr &amp; these two outshine any in the past.They never stopped working...
The pilot couldn’t park the plane properly... that was the hold up? Seriously? @SouthwestAir
Hey @SouthwestAir thanks for an awful flight experience. Nothing quite like landing an hour late and then spending another 40 minutes on the tarmac because y’all don’t take care of your equipment at OAK. It better not take another hour for my luggage to come out.
@SouthwestAir I’m at CLE airport, what do y’all got going on? It’s at least 50 people waiting to check in and check their bags and not one worker is present 🥴
Ugh...it's 2am &amp; we still don't have our bags from @SouthwestAir. Crew was late, so we got out late. Now baggage is late bc....reasons. We were *supposed* to get in at 12:45am. I gotta work in &lt;7hr. Not cool. I love you guys, but future me is already tired. #BaggageClaimBitter
@SouthwestAir I will not fly on 737 Max 8 aircraft. If that means avoiding your airline so be it.
@SouthwestAir Thanks! I will call in the morning.
My friend’s flight was supposed to land at 12:05 AZ time. It’s 1:48 and her luggage is nowhere in sight. My last 3/4 flights were also delayed for almost 2 hours. What’s up with that, @SouthwestAir ?
@SouthwestAir I was also told by customer service that Customer Relations is closed til Thursday. Is that correct??
@SouthwestAir Took an hour and a half. Unacceptable. I have sent emails.
I’m not sure if I’ll be flying @SouthwestAir any longer. We’ve been sitting for an HOUR following landing. On top of that, the flight took off 20 minutes late, and we couldn’t get beverage service or use the bathroom. 🥺
@SouthwestAir had a terrible experience waiting for luggage after a flight from St. Louis to Houston and am being told Customer Relations isn't open until Thursday. This is insane and will likely be the last time I fly Southwest.
@SouthwestAir I got to my gate at 11:30pm and I got my bag at 12:19. This is the usual at LAX not holiday traffic
How did we land at OAK airport @SouthwestAir at 10:10 and I’m still waiting on our suitcases at bag check?? This whole experience made worst when my partner heads to surgery at 4 am. This is an absolute mess.
@SouthwestAir Shocking. If your flights were on time, your customer service demand would be lower. You made 70 people wait and made them 45 minutes late - because we had to wait for passengers from a different, late Southwest flight. That fails all logic
@SouthwestAir not thrilled with virtually no wi-fi on flight from PHX-ATL with 5y/o twins who were expecting to use their iPads. I know it’s a luxury, but if it’s offered &amp; I pay for it, I expect it to work. It’s worth paying more for another airline if I can get wi-fi.
@SouthwestAir did us so dirty!! Flight supposed to land at 9:30p didn’t get my bagsss until 11:00p.. how?!
@SouthwestAir Finally at our gate. Thanks for the replies.
Just had the worst flight and baggage pick up experience with @SouthwestAir and honestly I’m more disappointed than anything because they used to be my go-to. Never. Again.
@SouthwestAir Yep and they had terrible attitudes. Great organization 🤟🏾
@SouthwestAir Looks like we are finally moving towards a gate.
@SouthwestAir We’re now 50 minutes on the tarmac.
Shoutout to @SouthwestAir for sending my luggage to New Mexico with my work computer in it. I feel sorry for the customer service person who answers my call tomorrow
Flight was delayed an hour. Times kept changing. Finally landed in FTL and I’ve been waiting for my bags for over 30 minutes and the carousel screens are all wrong. WTF @SouthwestAir i wanna go home !!
@SouthwestAir Flight 3242 out of MDW
@SouthwestAir Later... After 43 minutes, they are finally ready. You owe me $150 for my time. Where do I send the bill?
@SouthwestAir Why 2 hours? We've got plenty of time. Your flights are always late
@SouthwestAir Pay you extra to sit on the tarmac even longer waiting for passengers from your other late flights? What a horribly crappy deal
2 airports today. THE ONLY airlines with flight delays??? @SouthwestAir - every single flight on the board
@SouthwestAir can you help? Flight 3242 is on the tarmac in Oakland with no sign of a gate opening soon.
Flight was delayed originally, got on new plane, now landed and waiting for 45 minutes to get off plane. @SouthwestAir you’re really not my fav
Anddddd of course @SouthwestAir lost my luggage. Lmao
Another day, another @SouthwestAir clusterf*ck 1 hr, 20 min delay at Reno, even though they had empty plane at next gate, not scheduled to leave for 2 hrs 30 min delay (and counting) at Vegas waiting on passengers on yet another delayed SW flight I bill $75/hr. You owe me $150
And now we are just waiting for it to start again?? So I’m going to be leaving the airport at like MAYBE 2 am after landing at like 12:30? lmao just remembered why I hate flying @SouthwestAir
Hey @SouthwestAir at Boston Logan - 45 minutes after landing at 1:13 AM and our bags still haven’t started to drop. #dobetter
What ever it costs to not fly @SouthwestAir, I'll gladly pay it. Smh.
@SouthwestAir never fails not only is flight late and not weather related but you dont have a gate when plane arrives well after midnight. SMH
@SouthwestAir 2:45 mins late. I was frustrated but made it home. Most ppl on flight missed their connections. STILL DONT KNOW WHY. Your late twitter reply not enough-in fact just worse. Can you tell me if i have any refund recourse?
@SouthwestAir can you please get me on a flight that doesn’t get delayed 2-3 times before I can board ?
@SouthwestAir flight 30 BWI to PHX total nightmare. Weather delay I get but too much fuel? Electrical issue now a battery part. They have the part but waiting for someone to deliver it. 4+ hr delay. This is brutal.
@SouthwestAir you guys run a pretty shitty Burbank to Oakland route. Work on that. Always delayed at least an hour and you don’t ever announce that until 10 minutes before. #jetblue
@SouthwestAir PHX. Thanks! This helps. 2 hours it is!
@SouthwestAir There was no weather issue in Texas at that time. I understand that weather can become an issue but putting on a pilot who only had 15min left of his shift was in the control of the company 🤷🏻‍♀️
@SouthwestAir So we'll expect a pretty full flight. Thanks for the info, Jeni!
@SouthwestAir my daughters bag’s wheels straight out of baggage claim belt are so damaged we can’t even roll it. What can we do to resolve this?
Listen @SouthwestAir we need to chat. When we book/pay for a nonstop/direct flight &amp;said flight is changed to add a stop,why are we not directly notified &amp;flight itinerary changed to reflect it? #Refund #TravelersBeware #ProofOfDeception will report this issue when energy returns
We travel EVERY holiday choose @SouthwestAir 99.9% of the time. We ALWAYS run into some kind of travel issues and this year’s chronicles took the throne. Sat almost 2 hours on the tarmac AFTER landing and waited for our baggage for 45 mins and they were SOAKING wet! #SoNotHappy
Never ever ever eeeeevvvveerr flying @SouthwestAir again. $600+ for flights home for the holidays to get 6 hours of delays, spending all day in an airport and praying I don’t get my flight cancelled and told I gotta sleep here.. just get me home please holy hell.
No flights out of San Jose after 2pm on 1/11 @SouthwestAir ??
the sage continues. @SouthwestAir customer support just hung up on me. this is ridiculous.
@SouthwestAir flight #2630 from Phil to San Antonio - lands in Houston and the captain is no where to be found... at this rate it takes longer to get out of Houston than it does to actually fly to San Antonio.
@SouthwestAir I am on flight 4405 Las &amp; attendant Amber kept challenging my service dog &amp; delayed flight &amp; got another man Kenny to board plan who asked me over 8 times loudly if he is a service dog. Im mortified!
@SouthwestAir Have an administrator call me from your “executive office.” A few other members of your team say it is possible. I was told there is always someone at corporate willing to address overall customer issues. So, you are presenting alternate facts on my account.
@SouthwestAir I am taking off now on 4405 from Las &amp; flight attendant Amber challenged my service dog &amp; kept repeating asking about if he is a service dog &amp; then held plane up &amp; got Kenny to board plane &amp; he loudly kept asking if he is a service dog over 8 times!! I’m mortified
shocked I'm tweeting this. boarded a @SouthwestAir flight SEA&gt;SJC &amp; an Asian guy in front of me asked an American woman in the third/fourth row if he can sit next to her &amp; she denied him &amp; said there are many seats in the back...
@SouthwestAir Hey Southwest! Love you guys but tonight in Hobby’s baggage claim was horrendous. Over an hour for bags after a long flight
Okay @SouthwestAir if you’re going to delay a flight for 3+ hours, couldn’t your people have the decency to let us know WHY and WHATS GOING ON??!! #OakToLas
@SouthwestAir Late arrival...change of information, still no bags. BWI needs help.
So @SouthwestAir I ordered 1 plane ticket you took the money out of my bank account twice now I'm broke I need 1 of them back
@SouthwestAir i haven't been able to view my reservation for over a week on desktop and the android app. "We are currently unable to complete your request due to a delete boarding pass service error." error code 400620347 on both devices
@SouthwestAir thanks to flight attendant Matt on flight 5779 tonight from Boston to Chi! He truly went above and beyond to help this mom flying solo w/ 2 littles!
@SouthwestAir I was on flight 5541 from Tampa to Pittsburgh. The flight attendant took my drink order and my drink voucher. The flight then became too turbulent so they stopped the beverage service and I never received my drink. Is there any way you can replace my drink voucher?
@SouthwestAir overall like your airline and fly it a lot. But your WiFi is horrible. Not even the free web sites work. I flew four flights since last Thursday and WiFi worked reliably on none. You’re the only airline with this problem.
Dear @SouthwestAir please let me get to my destination before I go back to work 🙏🏾🙏🏾 1 cancelled flight, 2 days lost of vacay, 7 hours in 2 different airports and a delayed flight later, I’m still sitting in an airport remembering why I drive every where 😭😭😭
@SouthwestAir I see y'all replying to people but not me! Check your dms please
@SouthwestAir pls get ur shit together
Whoop dee do a hotel after you told us the flight would be held. Absolute garbage @SouthwestAir
I wish the @SouthwestAir staff in Nashville, TN would update its passengers ....
@SouthwestAir what is happening? Baggage issues at MSY and OAK. Is it you or the airports? OAK seemed to just be SW impacted... +60 min to get bags at claim.
Pilot just told us to tweet @SouthwestAir to get this moving 🤣
@SouthwestAir and your on board movies don’t work either. On two flights. #goodgod #swa! Why do I continue to fly #southwest? Dogs running around on flights, entertainment not working. #getyourshittogether #alistpreferred #customerservice #bad you get #2pf10
@SouthwestAir why the long delay from Indy to Orlando on flight 5305?
I need 27k points in the next 72 hours to qualify for a companion pass @SouthwestAir. Lol it’s 10 pm and we goin’ to Vegas. #LETSGO
Petition for @SouthwestAir to get plugs or USB ports on their planes
2 hour delay ✅ Seats from a Vietnam prison camp ✅ Plane smells like a condom ✅ No TV ✅ Plane is 85°F ✅ Old guy next to me shit his pants ✅ 3 hours to go ✅ It’s @SouthwestAir time let’s fucking go 😎
@SouthwestAir had the worst flight experience of my life on 12/23. Flight out of Las Vegas to SFO was at 930am, didn't land until after 4pm, we were given no information or anything. This is now 3 straight flights through you guys that have been delayed. Might think twice now.
@SouthwestAir I DONT have the money to pay for a hotel room.
@SouthwestAir so not only did I miss my flight due to "weather conditions" I'm Nashville, I'm now expected to pay for a hotel on my own???
@SouthwestAir The 31st of December 2019 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
@SouthwestAir I just got a random lady's boarding pass in my email. Any way to check into that?
@SouthwestAir No the crew couldn't serve us because of the bad weather. Just a bummer that's all.
@SouthwestAir No didn’t make a claim
Dear @SouthwestAir, I can deal with a 3:40am cancelation on Christmas Eve &amp; landing in time to make my connection only to see that my boarding pass was cancelled &amp; my flight changed &amp; watching my plane pull away from the gate, but no more Oceans 11? You’re killing me, Smalls.
I just spoke with Tricia who is a Service Coordinator and was equally nasty stating that not every service center had the new software to find my info like the first rep did. She said Victoria was doing her job in a nasty tone @SouthwestAir I expect a call. Thanks so much.
I wanted to argue with her but I quickly remembered that AA let there employees fight their customers! I just let it go and remembered that my main airlines is @SouthwestAir #Imnotbeingdruggedofftheplane
@SouthwestAir Is there anything I can do about it now? This kind of changes our whole trip.
@SouthwestAir when I said April 2019 I believe. She said she cannot find flight information without me giving an exact date and said her supervisor would say the same. She is beyond rude and I expect something done about this!
@SouthwestAir called to get my voucher info for a flight cancelled due to weather from a great agent named Candace. I must have dictated the information incorrectly and just called in. Speaking to a rep named Victoria who is nasty and asking me what week the flight was
@SouthwestAir I keep getting delayed. I have work in the am. Can I atleast get some points for my troubles?
Missing the family Hanukkah party because @SouthwestAir delayed my flight so their freight wouldn’t miss the flight. Really?!
@SouthwestAir I will gladly complete a net promoter/satisfaction survey for this flight. 20 minutes in and the worst #SWA attendant I have experienced.
@SouthwestAir ... nashville to chicago a 4 hour delay.. really? That’s halfway to driving. Please just get us home. We really enjoy spending money at the bar watching football when I should have been home hours ago. #wtf #SouthwestAirlines #southwestisnolongerthebest
Me on @SouthwestAir Flight attendant to me- “Sir, are you saving this seat for your wife?” Me- “I don’t recall having a wife with me but let me know, I’ll take her.” Old guy near me- “DONT GET MARRIED KID.”
@SouthwestAir It's a observation on those nasty flight attendants on 2700 today FLL to SJU. More careful chosen those attendants. It's time to go back to United or JBlue. Known SWA x 25 years.
@SouthwestAir I understand the rule and it makes sense when two adults are trying to board together. You and I both know that the adult with the lower position boards first and saves the seat for the other adult. I don’t have that option.
@SouthwestAir I DMed you the confirmation number.
@SouthwestAir you know, it’s great that attendants try to be funny, but when they #offend, #demean, and make #shitty comments to people in the process, it sucks. Flight 1114. This guy is #awful. #poorattitude train your people #SWA
@SouthwestAir, please change your boarding policy to accommodate A-List Pref Members who are solo parents traveling w a child in another group. My 8 y/o is too old for family boarding &amp; too young to board alone. We tried to board together with As &amp; were rudely and loudly denied
@SouthwestAir, lack of customer service with flight 2240 to kc. Huge delay, now arriving almost 3 am but you don’t care about that. #SouthwestAirlines
Just flew @SouthwestAir from Orlando to Austin and the lead flight attendant, Grace, was truly amazing. Kind, funny, in charge, and all kinds of patient with a solo child passenger who was pretty challenging. 💗💗💗
@SouthwestAir my flight has been delayed again. I have been at the airport for 5 hours. No one is wanting to help.
But shout out to @SouthwestAir for holding me down. Anyone talking shit about them is going down, like how I felt my heart going down as I had a panic attack during take off ✈️✈️✈️
I wish @SouthwestAir would have given us a update about our flight being delayed a hour awhile ago instead of getting a notification 20 mins after scheduled take off time.
@SouthwestAir a student discount would be nice...
@SouthwestAir You consistently disappoint. Your service is horrendous. One more on your worthless airline and I’m done.
Dear @SouthwestAir, your baggage claim organization at BWI tonight leaves much to be desired.
@SouthwestAir 2 delayed flights and now you take my 24” bag that I’ve flown with 3 times this week. Congrats to me on earning my companion pass tonite with your airline. How about consistent and attentive agents in Baltimore that actually give a damn.
@SouthwestAir I am super claustrophobia so I do the responsible thing and pay to get on first. The FA then moved my bag without asking me waaaaaaay behind me so I had to move back and so although I laid to be first I am way uncomfortable even though I planned ahead. Unfair.
@SouthwestAir Yes and i have another flight tomorrow so they’re saying they’ll get it there but we’ll see. A huge inconvenience when i have no clothes or anything at the moment
@SouthwestAir Been waiting for 1 1/2 hours for my son to arrive at the Memphis Tennessee airport on flight from DALLAS tonight due to a diverted flight in their arrival gate!! That is unacceptable that a backup plan is not available for similar situations!! Come on Man!!
@SouthwestAir would be nice if you kept people updated with real info that actually was true
@SouthwestAir got delayed traveling with 2 small kiddos and couldn’t get a voucher because the delay was “somewhat weather related”. What does that even mean?
@SouthwestAir Gotta give a shout-out to one of your ticket agents at PHX gate C-13 who very professionally handled an incident where family was late to flight to OKC and was venting on agent who maintained her cool and defused the situation. They were late of their own accord.
@SouthwestAir I’m confused why some counter agents say they can set up my medical preboard round trip, some say “can’t “ Has to be done each flight?! Why can’t it be put in my flight record? Dbl knee replacement isn’t changing my medical issues are what they are
@SouthwestAir Had this happen on today's flight. Person boards in A group with EB then proceeds to hold seats for 2 other persons who were in C group. Then proceeds to chirp how she beat the system. While I always bought 2 EB before I now know how to "cheat" your system unless U change it.
@SouthwestAir Trust me, I’m not disappointed at all. I’ll just have to purchase 2 one way tickets I. Separate transactions so I don’t pass the 4 card rule. Thanks for responding!!
@SouthwestAir apparently your twitter and crew are all trained by the same people. Not going to fly with y’all anytime soon.
@SouthwestAir you guys have delayed every single one of my flights for the past two months. I’m over it
@SouthwestAir I have been waiting for 40 minutes to get my bag in St. Louis! Arrived from Little Rock at 7:30 PM. The flight is not even on the board!!!
@SouthwestAir why is flight 4147 delayed?
Bummed with @SouthwestAir. 24 hr Travel delays due to maintenance issues and all I asked for was upgraded boarding on my new flight. Was told no.
@SouthwestAir we have been sitting on the tarmac sucking on jet fumes AT OUR DESTINATION for almost an hour because of a refueling plane... This is ridiculous.
can i have a free flight to Houston and back for NYE @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir any updates on what the hell is happening with flight diverted to Memphis?!? We have been sitting on the plane with no info!
Really disappointed with how @SouthwestAir treated three military service members on a recent flight. They are allowed to board early but only if in uniform. They had id's but were not in uniform. Rude treatment by gate person. Saw it with own eyes.
I just used about every privilege of @SouthwestAir's A-List in about a 10 minute period. I've now tasted power. It's dangerously delicious. Thanks #Southwest #AList #LUV #Whyflyanyoneelse
@SouthwestAir If it wasn’t for my sister who scooped me up mid air I would’ve fallen. We explained my limitations to the two employers prior to the transfer. Plus they rushed us out the plane before my chair was ready and I had to wait strapped on a faulty aisle chair for 5-10 minutes
@SouthwestAir I received 4 different gift cards, is there anyway someone from customer support can put them on 1 gift card? #ihopeso
@SouthwestAir Is there a point of contact in the company where I can thoroughly voice my concern about traveling missteps disabled passengers face. This wasn’t the only incident from my trip. I experienced a near drop being transferred into my seat when I landed in Kansas City the 21st
@SouthwestAir mimosas hit different. That’s it. Thank you.
.@SouthwestAir your crew’s communication with this diverted flight is AWFUL!! We know nothing and have been sitting here missing connections. Shame on your staff.
@SouthwestAir CAN YA AT LEAST TELL ME WHY
@SouthwestAir Yes we made our claim last night and that went smoothly. I just wanted people to see how not to handle people’s only means of getting around. It’s the principle of the situation. I think this can be a good teaching moment for employees handling these important pieces of equipment
Thank you gate rep at a8 in rdu #yourock. You got us back home on time!! @SouthwestAir #waytogosw #thankyou
@SouthwestAir 3166 to LGA is delayed over an hour because you guys had to clear it from international or something? This is completely unacceptable. I can understand delays due to weather or maintenance but this was a failure on your part.
changed my initial flight to avoid delays, got on an earlier flight that is now delayed 3.5 hours. no communication at the gate and the flight itinerary is no longer showing on my app, not a great day with @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir what the heck is going on with flights between BUR and SFO? My flights both ways in the last few days are over 1.5 hours delayed!
Hey @SouthwestAir thank you for your terrible customer service and for screwing me over on my way home after the holidays. Tons of people without places to stay tonight stranded because of you
@SouthwestAir Oh, I got an alert 15 minutes after I arrived at the airport. So there's that.
@SouthwestAir Ok. Cool. Friends are on the flight and just making sure. Yes safety first!
@SouthwestAir IF YOU LOVE YOUR PET DON’T FLY SOUTHWEST!
@SouthwestAir Any info on when they will be heading back to Nashville? Tonight? Tomorrow?
Hey @SouthwestAir we need to talk about how long your boarding times are getting. Unbelievably slow both legs of this trip.
@SouthwestAir what is the best way to buy an airline ticket for child with cancer for treatment and their mother? It is a family member. Should I just log in to my SWA account and buy the tickets for them to go where they need to go?
@SouthwestAir — I appreciate you even more after today’s flight! Thank you for being so reasonable &amp; family friendly.
Hey @SouthwestAir, what is going on with flight 3516?
@SouthwestAir does a 40" longboard check for free regardless of if I already have two checked bags?
@SouthwestAir flight 2854 the worst ever
@SouthwestAir claimed, we cant guarantee you got to denver on another airline. WHAT THE HELL!?!? HOW CAN I GET THERE IF ALL THE FLIGHTS ARE CANCELLED! I have two southwest CC and quickly paging those off and putting it back in my wallet. Absolutely horrible.
@SouthwestAir Blessed to be on the last leg of my journey home to #OKC because that last flight tested my patience. I’ve never had an adult that was in constant motion for an entire flight including eating siting next to me ✈️🛫😳✈️🛫😳✈️🛫
our flights from San Diego to denver was cancelled 12 hours before departure. We called and all flights were booked or cancelled due to weather. We had to cancel the trip however @SouthwestAir and we bought our return flights separately. SW is only giving me 200 of the 400 back.
@SouthwestAir is by far the best airline to travel with. Best customer service &amp; plus all the in flight amenities they offer! You’ve definitely gained a lifetime flyer that’s forsure ✈️❤️
Hey @SouthwestAir how about some Communications from the flight deck on how much longer this delay will take!!! #nothappy Flight SNA to OAK #4605
🙄😤😡🤬 #TFW @SouthwestAir changes your direct (w/ stop, no change) to a delayed plane change layover in Dallas, arriving at home much later than planned, inconveniencing me, my family, and the folks I was supposed to be picking up. Not really #Transfareancy 🙄
@SouthwestAir I travel for both work and pleasure and I just see a difference between how airlines operate. Delta/airfrance I do more for NYC and international flights and Southwest for domestic, and as an economical shortie, southwest matches my vibe
@SouthwestAir And then not have their bag! This is you second mistake for Christmas travels, I’ve had. Both have been negligence of your employees. #DoBetter
@SouthwestAir denied snacks (due 2 turbulance) on flights to &amp; from Buffalo. Say you'll "make it up to me?" Good. I'm flying 1/13 &amp; 1/25 from DCA - LAX. I request triple pretzels. Let me know if u want flight numbers. #notkidding #skinnyandhungry
Want to know how great @SouthwestAir is? In Denver I’m A25 a loyal SWA A Lister and my 12 old for some checked in with me and he’s C3 asked if he can board with me and they said no. Yeah real family oriented.
@SouthwestAir If I don’t land in STL until 10:30, how am I going to get onto my 10:45 connecting flight to HOU in time? 😒
@SouthwestAir amazing staff at FLL tonight!! Helped us get the earlier flight, were so patient, and generally made the airport an easy experience!
Hey @SouthwestAir you should provide an option that allows people who are picking up family members/friends to get notifications on their phone about flight departure/arrival via the app so they know when to leave for pickup. Please DM me for more info. Thanks.
@SouthwestAir I always purchase the Early Bird. Best way to sit where you’d like. Not a guarantee, but improves your chances.
@SouthwestAir I always do! I love having the EB option!
@SouthwestAir do you wanna tell me why my flight is taking off at 1:10 AM? You don’t think that’s somewhat ridiculous, especially for no reason.
@SouthwestAir I was just told by your baggage dept rep that bags are not scanned at departing airports but only when they arrive at destination. Is that really true? I am trying to track my daughter’s lost bags but they have no idea where they are.
@SouthwestAir help! my KTN is entered into my account profile but this is now the second flight where my TSA Precheck hasn’t shown up on my boarding pass... The agent at the counter was less than helpful last time. Any ideas???
Shoutout to Roger on @SouthwestAir 5359. Southwest flight attendants are always great but he’s the best.
@SouthwestAir I’ve never before had my flight delayed bc we had to wait on other passengers whose inbound planes are late, much less waiting more for the luggage to transfer for those now seated passengers. It’s been 60min: what’s the policy for this situation? I´ll plan better
@SouthwestAir the second time this week my flight has been delayed to errors on your end. One mechanical and one scheduling. C’mon people
@SouthwestAir I recommend you take care of your airplanes so you don’t delay your customers.
@SouthwestAir Can you help us out? I'm taking a 16yo family friend on a trip this week. Can he access his boarding pass on the Southwest mobile app if he doesn't have an account with you? Or, is there any way to track down his RR# if he already exists in your system? Thanks!!
@SouthwestAir Pretty frustrated with MULTIPLE changes to an itinerary. I understand Max grounding is challenging for SW, but multiple involuntary changes are difficult when lodging/activities have already been booked.
@SouthwestAir I am on the flight right now (3319 from Memphis to Orlando) and my dog is terrified and barking!!! Why can’t I put him on my lap?????? What is your reasoning behind this policy??
@SouthwestAir hates your pets! Don’t fly!
@SouthwestAir just my take on American Airlines not ordering Boeing rather going 2 buy from European airline Airbus is just plain weird. Personally, I will not fly on anything but Boing. If Southwest Airlines does go the way of not supporting the Country that made them, I'm out
Thanks @SouthwestAir! Just flew MSY to MDW. Took off late but arrived on time. Turbulence was supposed to be so bad there was no service. But I'd rather have safety first. And almost no bumps so thanks to the pilots and crew. Another reason to fly with ❤️.
Yesterday @SouthwestAir from PHX to DEN... ...After my flight got cancelled, and I got bumped to the back of the bus. Tween girl actually asked me, "Are these the planes that crash?" Me: "No, sweetheart. Those were planes with African pilots" *popcorn*
@SouthwestAir Why didn’t you say I could go and get it 3+ hours ago. The lack of communication is amazing. I was finally able to get in touch with them on the phone (I called them, they did not call me).
@SouthwestAir Rachel, thanks for your nice reply. We confess that we were bothered by the woman saving all the seats for he’d family when we paid for our early birds. There are more important things, but i appreciate your reply!
@SouthwestAir I will tweet everyday about how horrible your costumer service is until you make this better!
@SouthwestAir TV not working right now so the only Eagles/Giants game I can watch is that scene in Invincible.
@SouthwestAir Not the finest moment at MEM today- at 4:35pm CST. Fly By Priority was not open, which was not apparent, and when I asked, I was told to step in a pretty long line in a tone and manner UNLIKE SWA. Happy to provide details, please message me.😞
Hey @SouthwestAir you suck! You said via DM at noon that my bag is at SAN but I cannot get a hold of them and they have not called to confirm that I can pick it up. What gives? Where is my bag?????#CustomerService #CustomerExperience #southwest
@SouthwestAir is the worst airline to fly if you have a pet! They will treat your babies like luggage! The flight attendants on 3319 are rude and not accommodating!
@SouthwestAir southwest what will you do to make your flight experience better for pets??? Or will you just treat them like luggage???
yall hoes @SouthwestAir come get this work bitch
@SouthwestAir the flight attendants on flight 3319 are joking around making jokes and not being respectful to the passengers.. they would rather crack jokes while giving us important information then take care of the passengers. The worst flight attendants ever!
@SouthwestAir DONT FLY IF YOU HAVE A DOG THEY WILL TREAT IT LIKE LUGGAGE!!!!!! Horrible rude disrespectful flight attendants on flight 3319!
@SouthwestAir is anti dog.. why can’t his head stick out from his carrier??
@SouthwestAir is making my little less than 5 pound dog be in a little bag under a dark seat... why can’t he just sit in my lap and not bark?? Only airline that is so strict! Just got in trouble with a flight attendant who was rude and told me he can’t stick his head out? WTF SW?
@SouthwestAir We just checked in about an hour ago and got mid range B. So that’s good. I remember seeing a sign at the terminal in Atlanta to see attendant for A1-A15 upgrade. How much are those typically if they are still available?
@SouthwestAir your IT dept still hasnt fixed the issue .... slacker millennials
I’m gonna need @SouthwestAir to stop putting sad movies on their app. Watching Toy Story 4 and Lion King and BAWLING MY EYES OUT CASUALLY IN THE AISLE SEAT.
SOS: @SouthwestAir help! I need 3,000 points to qualify for companion pass. Have any suggestions other than booking a flight for today or tomorrow?
Need assistance please @SouthwestAir regarding luggage issue (for my father). Please DM me. Thanks in advance
@SouthwestAir Any idea when we will see the schedule extended through November 2020?
The C boarding group at @SouthwestAir stands for Clowns. There I said it. - C 1
The tricks people play to hold seats @SouthwestAir is ridiculous. Man in A group put bags in empty row to hold seats, while he sits in the middle of another row to hold 2 rows! Go ahead and lay down in a row! Why do I pay for Earlybird for my family when no one prevents this?
@SouthwestAir No, it was for tonight
@SouthwestAir dented and cracked my suitcase happy holidays :)
@SouthwestAir Don't worry about being there 2 hours before, the flight is 99% going to be delayed with soithwest
Thank you @SouthwestAir for not maintaining your aircraft’s! Back to back Christmas travels delayed because you can’t do simple maintenance! #why #delayedonceagain #delaysfordays #southwest #CustomerService
@SouthwestAir on my flight yesterday from Dallas to San Jose one of your flight attendants stopped me from sitting in the emergency exit row and said this row is for English speaking only and asked if I was, but she didn’t ask any of the other Caucasian passengers that sat there
Extremely frustrated with @SouthwestAir policies. Delayed 6hrs (stuck) out of the country now. Great job to the Cancun gate agents but terrible policy regarding refunds and vouchers.
@SouthwestAir my moms baggage was cracked what’s the damage policy? #traveltips
@SouthwestAir hi! We left a Mickey Mouse watch on your plan last night. Confirmation MB6YQM. Any help?? The
Quite a day of @SouthwestAir travel. First flight had a guy taken off by paramedics after passing out. Second flight had a guy puking down the aisle while boarding, so he got forced off of the flight by security. SWA employees handled both very well, but #GetMeHomeAlready
@SouthwestAir please do something to fix the hopeless luggage retrieval system in Las Vegas. We have been waiting 45 minutes.
@SouthwestAir how beautiful would it be for standby options to be available in the Southwest Airlines app? 😎😎😎
@SouthwestAir sad I couldn't use my 2 expiring drink vouchers on my DCA flight. 😭😭😓😓
Think I may have to use my @SouthwestAir points for this trip
@SouthwestAir Thank you but we got through to a representative finally.
@SouthwestAir Just got this status update: “Your Southwest flight, Flight 3726 on December 29 from TUS, now departs at 8:10 p.m. We're sorry for the delay.” Can you tell me what the delay is?
Soooo I left with 4 wheels on my luggage @SouthwestAir when it was returned to me I only had 3 wheels! 🤔😒🤦🏾‍♀️
Thanks @SouthwestAir for not closing my bag completely and getting its entire contents wet, along with no hot beverage service on flight# 2641 BWI-ATL
Not cool @SouthwestAir, my son, who is serving in the Navy, was told at Phx airport he couldn’t board early as active military bc he wasn’t wearing his uniform. He did have his id. I always prefer to fly SW but this has changed my mind!
@SouthwestAir I’m desperately trying to change my flight so I get home before the new year but nothing is showing as available on the website. Please help! PLEASEEEE
@SouthwestAir apparently a mechanical issue has our flight delayed three hours. We’ll miss our connection. Working to book a new flight. SO and I will likely miss work tomorrow. Can we get some compensation please?
@SouthwestAir seems to have chronic delay issues! I used to never have this problem but it has unfortunately become the norm. #delayed #SouthwestAirlines
I always enjoy the absolute idiocy of @SouthwestAir. Arrive at RDU a little late maybe 5 min &amp; have to sit for 30 min for a gate. Best part, there are 7 gates, only 3 actually have a plane there, but we have to wait for a gate that has a plane at it. #worstairline
@SouthwestAir Anyone can pre-board with their “emotional support” dog and zero proof, but a 7-ft tall man who clearly can’t fit in your seats can’t because it’s “genetic not medical”? BTW, Sharon in Boston needs serious customer service training.
@SouthwestAir How do you change my flight. My non stop flight and now make me stop and have a layover. Not flying southwest again. No explanation just hey we changed your flight. 😡
@SouthwestAir I could have DRIVEN from Omaha to Midland in the time it took to fly there via Dallas on Southwest yesterday. I had an item from Walgreen's in my suitcase to return. Now it's ruined from my luggage being open in the rain in Dallas.
@SouthwestAir 6-7 gate changes (lost track), several delays, canceled flight, gate agents who "had no idea" where we should go, and soaking wet contents INSIDE my luggage is MORE than a little frustration! Luggage must have been opened in the rain. NOT OK! This is how you lose customers.
@SouthwestAir Safety I get but not able to tell me the where abouts of my child and why a four hour delay for a refuel customer service denies.... not good! Never ever mess with a mama bears cub! Shame on you Southwest! No communication leads to frustration!
@SouthwestAir Show some luv to Brandi at the Birmingham check-in counter. She was so helpful! #luv
@SouthwestAir He was lucky in Pensacola recently his friends and colleagues were not. Active service personnel will not be showing up in uniform at your gates so they can board after your A group. Your staff need to recognize active military IDs and show some respect.
@SouthwestAir Hi. Can I bring children’s ice skates in a carry on bag or must they be in checked luggage.
Hey @SouthwestAir ....🙋🏻‍♀️just trying to get a response. I’ll be calling later to talk to as many people as I can
@SouthwestAir Wasn’t a huge issue for me. But might be for someone who paid for Early Bird...
@SouthwestAir I have been flying southwest my entire life and have never experienced such poor service than at Houston hobby. Completely horrible day and lost a day I could have spent with my family. Horrible service.
@SouthwestAir We just did. Also called ONT lost &amp; found and left a message.
Just found out my @SouthwestAir flight is direct from Lovefield to Harlingen and I don’t think I’ve ever been happier. More of these plz!!
Thanks @SouthwestAir for helping me find a better flight back which allows me to spend more time with my family. #LUVSWA #nowtwirl
@SouthwestAir Thanks for responding. Still a very disappointed customer who is traveling with family and on a vacation. Don't think the staff here has the same appreciation for what you refer as "world-class hospitality"
@SouthwestAir PS I just thought after so many years of such Loyalty 380 points was reasonable for you to spot me
@SouthwestAir Yeah I don't really have a choice... Hopefully I can get a refund for this important milestone in my life. 😐
@SouthwestAir The delays in Houston are going to make us miss an engagement dinner I've already paid for for my fiance in Dallas. Thanks for the "assist."
@SouthwestAir You need to understand that active military the Navy and Airforce can’t travel in uniform. They’re serving the country get little time off and when flying home need to be prioritized. He showed his active ID this should be enough. Wearing a uniform isn’t allowed
@SouthwestAir Either the entire southwest customer base has gotten sicker over the years or people have caught onto your system to avoid paying the early boarding fee. It’s totally out of control these days. #frustratedflyer
@SouthwestAir Sorry if I wasted your time
@SouthwestAir I have Cancer studies winding down probably late Jan early Feb
@SouthwestAir what a fuckin joke you all are today! A flight from Indy the Hobby 8 hours later?? Circled, refueled, sat for 4 fours in San Anton! Shame on you! Trust? Respect? Care? Transparency? BS!!! Now no bags?? WTF!
@SouthwestAir waiting for a delayed flight for over 2 hours at the Orlando airport to Pittsburgh and when asked the agent about the gate change, her response is, "listen to the announcements and don't ask me"...#poorservice #SouthwestAirlines
@SouthwestAir like dang I been flying wit y’all for about 3 years now and once we have issues. BOOM! No response
@SouthwestAir No we were landed in our destination city. And stayed on the tarmac waiting for another plane to vacate our gate for 55 minutes.
@SouthwestAir Yes. I got in late last night. Tried reaching out to departing/arriving airport and haven’t been able to get a hold of anyone.
@SouthwestAir complained about a issue a few times and y’all ain’t never responded. Can y’all at least respond in the DMs!?
Hey @SouthwestAir I don’t want to be the grinch but this preboard system you have is getting out of hand. There must me 60 preboarders on my flight. What good is A-list status or a business select seat If I end up in row 20.
@SouthwestAir The only airline who has never let me down &amp;&amp;&amp; continues to have A-1 customer service 💯💯💙
@SouthwestAir My sons a Naval Officer at Sky Harbor Phoenix flying to Nashville been told he boards last with Active Military Id
@SouthwestAir When people seated in the back of the plane rush to the front after landing to try to get out first and cause unnecessary aisle congestion, can you please make an announcement to regulate that? Happens all the time.
@SouthwestAir I arrived early and was delayed 3 hours due to maintenance with no announcement of this or apology. Then we taxed for another 30 mins due to paperwork. So it’s tough hearing “arrive early.”
@SouthwestAir the employees said the therapist knows what to put on the letter, implying the letter is fake which it is not.
@SouthwestAir Your policy for priority boarding for active military only in uniform is ludicrous as the Navy and Air Force don’t allow their personal to travel in uniform. Unpatriotic and letting our active military down.
@SouthwestAir I couldn’t find a way to do that on your website.
@SouthwestAir April 11 1964 PO Box 648 Pine Valley California 91962 or 28809 Jeffery Lane
@SouthwestAir how does one score a pass to the Southwest box at Ravens stadium?
Our @SouthwestAir flight landed an hour ago, and we’re still sitting here with no gate to deplane in. Babies are crying and it smells like a bathroom. Welcome home I guess.
I don’t understand why exit rows aren’t the first rows to fill on @SouthwestAir...not that I’m complaining. #SouthwestFirstClass
@SouthwestAir your employees at the MDW airport discriminated against me. My ESA letter was denied even though it is from a legitimate licensed therapist for a legitimate reason. They talked down to me and smirked at me.
Update on my situation about being yelled at multiple times - I would just like to say thank you to the @SouthwestAir social media support team and Kathy in Oklahoma for truly being so helpful and helping get home in time to help my mother ❤️ I cannot send enough praise 🙌🏻
@SouthwestAir I’ve already tried reaching to the airports and haven’t been able to talk to anyone.
@SouthwestAir what is goin on... flight 2925 has been on the tarmac for like 45 minutes with no explanation...
@SouthwestAir the flight crew let some people off but failed to tell them they could only get off if SA was their destination. So we waited for hours while they tried to figure that out 🤦🏻‍♀️
@SouthwestAir Broken kiosks, broken luggage belt, inadequate express-bag-check staff creating a long line just to check in bags that were self-tagged. Take lessons from Hobby where number of kiosks and bag-check staff keep up with holiday crowds nicely.
@SouthwestAir flight 3345 is now over 4 hours late to Houston after being rerouted to San Antonio. Can we at least get some drink tickets for the way home??
@SouthwestAir transfer me some points please or if anyone out there with too many points wants to help a girl out this holiday szn I would appreciate it 🥺
@SouthwestAir Please thank them on my behalf and for honoring Oscar Vargas! He still lives within my heart!
On my 50th (and hopefully last 🤞🏼) @SouthwestAir flight of the year! This is product of lots of work time and lots of family time this year. Feeling grateful and full (literally have eaten all the tamales. ALL). #Holidays2019 #TamaleBelly #FamilyTime
@SouthwestAir Thank you however, after 10 years* of loyalty, this is unacceptable for the limited options that are available and the prices that you charge for direct flights. I will no longer fly with Southwest after today.
@SouthwestAir your crew working at BWI should get a raise! Everyone was Super friendly and at the ticket counter decided to give our kiddo’s stuffed cat its very own boarding pass which he loved! We appreciate the little things!
