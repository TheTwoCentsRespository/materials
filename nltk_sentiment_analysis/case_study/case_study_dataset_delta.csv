@Delta I'm probably one of the 9 people on Earth who waited 69 years to fly Lol
@Delta I had severe damage to the contents of my luggage on a recent flight. My bag was clearly opened and repacked but there was no TSA slip as usually when TSA performs a check. Please help???
@Delta Salt Lake City did an amazing job rebooking us after a medical issue. I would love to thank the red coat agent who helped us today but didn’t get her name... can you help? She made a difficult situation easier knowing that we were still going to catch a flight tonight!!
@Delta Bags made the flight to San Antonio. We are in motel in NY because of flight delays and missed flights. No help on collecting luggage in SAT. Assured “somebody would store it for us”.
Still no bags. Driver said he no longer “has anything to do with this” and to contact other morning driver. This is getting ridiculous @Delta
@Delta I’ve sent you a dm!
Here are tonight's three stars, presented by Delta Air Lines - No one connects the world better @Delta ⭐️: Vesalainen (1🚨1🍎) ⭐️⭐️: Griffith (OT WINNER🚨) ⭐️⭐️⭐️: Gawanke (1🍎, unreal game)
@Delta Again Thank you and bless you Delta
#firsttweet. @Delta is awesome. Founda piece of paper from 2007 noting that I had 18k miles w/ NWA. They transferred them for me Automatically this year! Great customer service
May you never need to know this but @Delta has amazing systems in place to help if a family emergency disrupts or necessitates travel! No charge to cancel and then credit to rebook my return flight. Huge weight off my life in a shitty week!
@Delta you guys rock. Great flight home from LA to South Bend In. Thanks so much. #service
@Delta hi, I’m flying on Monday 6th Jan on KL6077. Myself, my wife and my daughter are looking to upgrade to comfort seats due to my bad back (I already have special assistance booked) can you help? Thank you.
@Delta thanks for letting me sit on your airplane for 1 1/2 hours for no reason other than incompetence, missing my connection, and adding an extra day to my trip. Thanks for the $15 voucher. That is $1.10 per hour you delayed me so far😡
@Delta we’ve been on hold for 50+ minutes waiting to buy a ticket. Is this normal?
@Delta oh that espresso negroni sky club drink special is to die for.
Hey @Delta lost an item (not in my bag) on my flight somewhere from Seattle to Minneapolis to Des Moines. How do I get it back?
Hi @Delta, i have tried to change me &amp; my bf’s flights for tomorrow morning bc we are recovering from the flu to a later flight. They were able to accommodate my flight but forgot to change my bf’s. Can someone please help
@Delta I’m trying to check-in for my return flight from jfk to Zurich but the app is asking me for a return date. Could you help me please?
@Delta Good evening, team. Can you help me with a delayed bag for a friend? It misconnected in ATL. I have his bag tag number and delivery address. He wasn’t able to file claim in Fly Delta App.
@Delta Thank you, I made it to my destination. Just try and get them to fix this. I traveled in November &amp; December and each time the bag check issue gets worse. Seriously, I fly at least 1 trip a month and I don’t think I can take the chance at booking a delta flight in February.
@Delta I have been at baggage claim for over 45 minutes already and watched many non priority bags pass me by - why even get platinum status?
@Delta curious why at BZE the entire desk staff takes lunch together so nobody can check in or check bags for half an hour
So, I heard stories about @Delta and their option to "opt out" of facial recognition. Apparently it's true. No, they don't like when you say you want to opt out. And no, they don't care how uncomfortable you are with it.
@Delta Left already had car service scheduled. All the overhead luggage on the right hand side facing the cockpit was wet. Weird odor for some.
@Delta Yes items in my backpack.
you even managed to fuck up the hotel vouchers @Delta
@Delta My two checked bags received better treatment than I did as I could see them being tracked on the app.
@Delta The delay is beyond the issue, me being at my gate 3 hrs b4 departure for a CONNECTION FLIGHT! yet being told that I couldn’t board Until right before the late departure is embarrassing &amp; stressful, no information as to why I was on hold even thou this is half of my flight plan.
@Delta Hi, I was unable to add my middle name to my basic profile when I booked my flight. My passport info does have my middle name on it in the international travel info section. Will this be a problem or can you update and add middle name to my basic profile?
minimum three hour wait to get me fucking bag?! are you fucking kidding me @Delta
@Delta DL3585. 60 min wait for luggage, unacceptable don’t you think? How can I get extra bonus miles for this wait, even tags marked SkyPriority. Reservation. HI9IEG
@Delta The flight attendants and pilot referred to your aircraft as “the reset jet”. Meaning this particular aircraft is notorious for not working. And that is absurd
@Delta One hour delay and maybe more...waiting for a co-pilot to be found for flight DL0044?! Is this Mickey Mouse airlines we're flying to Dublin?
@Delta Flight late leaving, late arriving at JFK, luggage delayed 25 minutes, missed flight by minutes, refused boarding on next flight rude gate shent slamming door early. Great experience
@Delta Lawrence the flight attendant on flight 1892 from YYZ to ATL today was warm, friendly and wonderful. What a great team member.
@Delta Second disappointing experience this year, both flying to Louisiana. Disappointing first class flight from MSY to JFK on 1/2: no water for coffee/tea or the bathroom sink AND only one meal option and all after a 1hr delay. Loyal customer, treat us better than this.
@Delta please can you delegate more employees to the Atlanta rebooking station in concourse E before I have a breakdown
My 4yo left a beloved rock on his seat (row 14) of flight 863 to ATL just now. Any chance we could get it back @Delta? I saw his tears and said I’d try.
@Delta I guess you don’t care and I don’t matter as I’ve already bought into your 1st class, huh?
@Delta Terrible. Nothing I ever do with Delta is on time. Now I have a religious commitment to push back my Friday flight and y’all wanna charge 200 to change it??? Never. Ever. Again. Will I fly with you!
@Delta Thanks again to Delta! I am a single mom and I have an autistic son at home. My father is 85 years old and sick. He lives in Florida. Your airline was very helpful at finding me better flights. They even let me fly out of PBI. It’s much closer &amp; I had no car
@Delta Flight 478 has been rerouted twice, and have been stuck on the plane for nearly 12hours. Totally get it’s not on you guys (what up US Customs), but could you order some pizzas?! 🙏🏼
Broken seat on @Delta flight 2067 to Memphis made a flight with turbulence even less comfortable! #SilverMedallion
@Delta no one at gate to help
@Delta you are better than this. $200 in flight vouchers is an insult, ESPECIALLY to a medallion holder that understands $200 in flight vouchers is equivalent to $50 of expenses to Delta.
@Delta Always weather from fort Myers ok sure! Number 1 in the delta playbook of excuses
@Delta are you kidding me? An ENTIRE tray of champagne and orange juice spilled ALL OVER me and my electronics - WELL in excess of $1,000 of damages...and you offer me $200!? All the while insinuating what happened isn’t true because a flight attendant has failed to document?
@Delta love missing my flight because of incompetence. the flight attendants were lit at least.
@Delta It’s about an hour now. For a company that cares about being ontime, this seems counterintuitive.
If you’re considering booking a @Delta flight because you forgot how terrible the entire airline is, I’m here on the most aggressive flight ever to remind you it’s the worst
@Delta GZ5ETF is my confirmation. This was absurd
@Delta flight 4836 overhead compartment items were wet when removed, items destroyed.
@Delta sitting on the Tarmac at JFK for 40 minutes because Delta can’t get us a gate. This airline Is ridiculous. We’re now 10 minutes after our expected arrival time. How is this possible?
@Delta Probably not with delta. Canceled my direct flight, replaced it with a layover in SLC, delayed for two hours, missed the connection, now stuck in the airport for 14 hours. 👎
@Delta probably the worst flight experience I have ever had yet, on an airline EVER
Thank you @Delta and especially Evelyn for helping me with my flight issues. Having previously worked at a travel BPO I know these matters can be time consuming, but Evelyn was so quick and so helpful. Thank you so much! ✈️
Hey @Delta my bags haven’t come yet. I’ve been waiting an hour and 20 minutes. I’m very disappointed
Oh @Delta you have always treated me well and this little game of hide and seek has been fun but now I need my bags back please #24hrlater #ineedmystuff #deltafail #baggagehideandseek
@Delta shoutout to Tim on DL2630. Super nice flight attendant and amazing service! #favoriteairline
@Delta 800s numbers wait is the same for regular and skymile members. What is the point then? 30 min wait time? And won't even let me Pre Check In 😅😅😅 #useless
So... @Delta unloaded bags off our flight from Ghana ... Delta does not know when my bags will be in nyc... my bags are still in Ghana. Probably unattended.
@Delta I'm trying to log into my Delta app and it's telling me my login information doesn't exist. Help?
@Delta paid for an upgrade to get a bulkhead bc of an accident I had and hurt my knee during this trip and when I got on the plane, I wasn’t in a bulkhead OR in a comfort seat that I was told I had to pay for! WTH?
@Delta Thank you acknowledging the mixup and for the voucher. Cheers! 🥂
On the return flight to NYC, almost everyone in my section is watching the Bills v Texans. Next up is the Titans v Pats. Will be a good flight. Thanks, @Delta for the live feed.
@Delta It'd be great if y'all just always served a pasta / veggie meal. Or upgraded folks sooner. ❤️
@Delta Damn, you had to ruin this relationship by asking me to take a survey.
hi @Delta, I love being upgraded on both flights today. you’re the best.
@Delta can I get some help with my skymiles account? I sent an email a few days ago but no response. #CustomerService
Despite arriving over 2 hours before our flight, @Delta misplaced 3 of the 5 bags on the way out. Eventually those arrived. On the way bag, they lost all 5 of our bags. Thousands and thousands of dollars potentially lost, hours of lost time and had to buy new clothing.
@Delta is it chill for me to have small wireless earbuds on a plane, or is that a no go.
Goddamn I love @Delta lounges with their Malin + Goetz products in the restrooms. I smell fucking expensive 🔮✨
#Deltaairlines @Delta I can’t believe Delta is not issuing waivers for travel to Sydney bc of the #sydneyfires. 60th birthday trip of a lifetime ruined.
@Delta I LOVE the customer service for my 70 year old wheelchair bound, oxygen tank wielding mother....taking her to a gate and LEAVING HER ALONE FOR 3 HOURS?!!?! DAFUQ ARE YOU DOING?!?!?! Oh I am sorry...was the purchase of a round trip first class ticket not enough?!?!
@Delta Delta, local hub was not helpful and said their had no real policy. They stated once the item is in Atlanta, there’s no chance getting it back. Who can we call at corporate?
@Delta why did you change my seat without asking me? I paid a lot of money for my seat. I chose it over a month ago. This is not ok.
@Delta Why are business passengers going thru the same experience, jammed into the same bus, no help offered for passengers who had difficulty navigating the bus and stairs up to the aircraft. We were all treated like cattle!
@Delta can someone please help me
hey @Delta you guys were able to find my address for filling my profile but you CAN'T use it for the billing address. Too bad for you bc I tried 15 times and decided to pay more with another company. Fix your app so I can be your client again :)
@Delta Thank you. Just want to be sure that these newly claimed 2019 MQMs don’t get lost in the shuffle because the bonus miles and older MQMs already rolled over. Thank you!
#DeltaProud how do I thank a @Delta employee who made a difference? just got off dl11 from London. Margaret looked after me, my partner and my son all the way home to #msp. #exceptional.
Never flying @Delta again, they were hella rude and when asked about military boarding early they told me no
@Delta said my flight was going to depart early, but now they've suspended boarding for a "maintenance issue". These MD-88s can't go to the scrap heap soon enough, IMHO. #DL2035
@Delta Hi I'm in Santiago airport (SCL) and you only have 2 person for bag drop in counter and the line and annoyance of the people is big. Is always been like this? :/
Dear @Delta I rarely put my light on for assistance, but when I do I t would be nice if someone actually acknowledged it? 15 min later.... nada #theworst
@Delta just transferred Bonvoy points to Skymiles to purchase a ticket, can you tell me how long before they show up? Don’t want to loose the flight deal.
There are no TVs on this @Delta flight and the only show I downloaded is the one I plan to binge from bed all day tomorrow. I played myself!
As if losing my uncle wasn’t bad enough, thanks to @Delta I had the worst travel experience and customer service ever AND missed his funeral. #DontFlyDelta
@Delta I just got off the phone with Steven one of your amazing representatives! Steven was able to work “delta magic” when our summer flight was changed. Delta continues to amaze us ! #loyalcustomers #flydelta 💯 Steven 🙏🙏🙏🙏
@Delta If any of my camera gear is broken...I’m coming after Delta. That’s my livlihood.
Thank you @Delta for the upgrade...or else I would’ve been sitting right next to little kids.
@Delta Thank you for providing me with the correct information on this issue. I appreciate your diligence and this is why I remain a loyal Delta customer. Thanks again
@Delta Are the NFL playoff games available on your flights?
@Delta Delta Flight 478 - GIG to JFK diverted to SJU because NO lavatory functioned on the aircraft. Not one word about the lav status. But plenty of info about another diversion to Miami due to Crew hours.
@Delta I love when I get a notification that I’ve been upgraded then find out right when I board, that I’m no longer upgraded. THANKS!
@Delta is just the best airline. Everything is easy. Their pre-takeoff music rocks. Their app has the best end-user experience—takes two seconds to find out if your plane will have outlets! I will never hop off my Delta soapbox!!!!
@Delta due to ground crew mess up at SJU my son will miss flight to STL. Reservation HYBEXB. Inflight now. I can get him on southwest for $300 fare tonight. Will you compensate?
@Delta asked us to change our direct flight to a layover in ATL. Now we’re sitting on a runway and are going to miss our adjoining flight with no more Flights to Indy tonight. Flying with 2 kids under 3!!! This is unacceptable. #fixthis
@Delta I will thank you for helping me.
@Delta simple question - are the lavatories fixed on the diverted Flight 478. On the ground since 4:34. Now headed to Miami. No word from crew on the lavs.
@Delta asked us to change our direct flight to a lay over in Atlanta. We reluctantly did it... now we have a 45 minute wait on the runway and are going to miss our joining flight.... with no more flights to Indy tonight. Flying with 2 kids under 3!!! #fixthis
@Delta It is terrible that they didn’t tell me before I was boarding as I didn’t purchase food for the flight bc I thought I had been upgraded
@Delta So I drop a person off for a 1650 dept BOS-DTW at 1600. DL agent won’t check bags told him he was late and rebooked him at 0530 tomorrow. This makes no sense to me?
@Delta Sólo dejo el comentario, ya abordaremos el vuelo de las 5:45, sin embargo me molestó el hecho que fueron ustedes los que retrasaron el vuelo de Durham - Atlanta y no tuvieron la delicadeza de esperar.
@Delta One of my flights was operated by Virgin (though ticketed by you); how long do those skymiles/MQMs take to come through? The other legs have been credited already
@Delta con la escusa de vuelos a tiempo, me dejaron en Atlanta, aún cuando ellos mismo retrasaron el vuelo de Durham a Atlanta, lo único que se puede pensar es por ser de El Salvador, si los que venían en el vuelo hubieran sido Norteamericanos seguro esperan.
@Delta I had the friendliest crew I’ve ever had on a flight today. DL1097 MCO to LGA with a stellar Milwaukee based flight crew. They deserve some kind of recognition!! Really made our experience unique and enjoyable.
JUST IN: @Delta confirms that the plane slid off the taxiway because of icy conditions.
@Delta I won’t be booking with Delta because you want me to pay a family tax just to sit next to my minor child. If you can guarantee I sit next to my minor child with a basic fare, I’ll be happy to book with you!
I will go very far out of my way to fly @Delta. Saving my butt today.
@Delta your team at the GJT counter were fantastic today! Thanks for the always great service.
@Delta No it didn’t change even we got to the new gate it’s still showing on the monitor that we’re boarding at the original gate!
@Delta 🤬🤬 Almost missed our flight bcoz you didn’t update the monitor! We got to the 1st gate 2hrs and 30 mins before our flight! Most of us waiting at the 1st gate! I got suspicious why not a lot of passengers are there so I have to ask a delta agent and she said we’re
@Delta my daughter got flu and can’t fly tomorrow. Can you waive 72 hr restriction and Re-deposit hard earned 40,000 miles? I’ll pay $150 change fee
@Delta Hey Delta air, what's going on with your Sea-NRT flight on Jan 8th. First you guys change the flight and downgraded my seats to main cabin and now you expect me to pay the full fare for seat changes to business..
If @Delta allows #MAGA hats, without exception, in their #skylounge, perhaps I will switch to airlines that don't allow racism etc to run rampant in their lounges. #resist
@Delta Still waiting for someone to fix the printer so the pilot can get his pperwoanf we can leave. I am thinking you need to have backup printer. And have now missed connecting flight. Oh. Yay.
@Delta Hello I left a very important bag on the plane with medication, the airports lost and found is closed, where do items go after the plane and where can I pick it up?
@Delta if you want people to continue to fly on your airline, please ask blatantly racists, homophobic, misogynistic "people" to refrain from wearing MAGA hats in your #skylounge. It's quite off-putting for those of us who feel all people should be treated equally.
@Delta Excuses! Next time I’ll short you 7 dollars for the fair since I’m 7 mins late. Seems fair, huh?
@Delta The flight is delayed and they made no announcement. Good heavens. Why is it so stressful traveling with yalll?? Can I ever have a on time flight???? I’m just gonna start driving
So glad I am back in #nyc since I can &amp; will feel comfortable calling out any #MAGA racist &amp; misogynistic assholes in real time. #resist #deltaneedsdresscodes #wedonttolerateracisminNYC #wedonttoleratemisogynyinnyc #TrumpIsALaughingStock @Delta
@Delta here we go again another delayed flight threatening to cause me to miss my flight.
@Delta So your telling me that within 20 mins we will be in the air? The plane just got here! Y’all do this every time. I got a shuttle to catch in Baltimore at 6 after baggage claim, I better not miss it!
@Delta S/O to the crew of flight DL2624, specially Benjamin. Been flying worldwide for about 20 years and he’s one of the best flight attendants I’ve ever met. Dude deserves a raise! Now please just make sure my bag arrives with me.. as I’m tweeting this while on the air 😬😬😬
@Delta Now standing in long line just to drop bags at #TUS . In MSP could've been construction, but If this is the new normal for #Delta I'll fly with someone else.
@Delta seriously? Sitting on plane because the printer is broken &amp; pilot can’t get his paperwork? Will miss connecting flight. Thank you for that and maybe start emailing paperwork to pilots #Delta
@Delta It's my Birthday! Please send me some wishes here on Twitter? 😘
@Delta can we stop with the fake Emotional support animals? By their behavior I can tell their not real.
@Delta DL2954 at B13 in Atlanta just tells us we will be boarding in 15 mins but there will be no delays from the 3:43 depart. The plane just got here. Can you guys ever be on time for anything? This is like Groundhog Day from the last time I traveled with y’all!
@Delta want to book a flight Nyc-mco. But your website doesn’t give the option to book check in bagage. Can we only buy this at the check in desk?
When you get home and discover that @Delta broke your luggage. #DoBetter
@Delta I responded in a DM
@Delta Is there some sort of compensation for future flights because of the headache? Now we get into New Orleans at 5 pm, and have to wait for our bags until 8 pm. It’s been a nightmare.
Hey @Delta how about reimbursing me the bullshit $70 I was charged to check my kid’s luggage when you pushed her flight back 6 hours with all of 12 hours notice? You are the worst airline out there. I think I’d rather take my dog on United before I’d use you again.
Dear @Delta sitting in one of your planes for two plus hours on a runway on Florida without air conditioning is a hell of a way to end my vacation. Miles? Extra flight? Something here
@Delta No alternatives for hours ... a delay is acceptable but to allow us to board only to have a maintenance issue that requires everyone is get off the plane is completely avoidable.
@Delta You’re welcome. She really helped us out and we didn’t even ask! Very happy to be a Dekta FF!
(2) his life at risk. We tried to explain he needs to get on early and have his seat and area sanitized and he did not let us board. Would like to speak to someone about this ASAP. @Delta
@Delta absolutely awful experience boarding from SJU to ATL. My nephew has medical special needs and your gate attendant Jose Sánchez denied my sister and her 2 children early boarding and made us stand in the way making him susceptible to contracting germs and putting (1)
@Delta Ticketing agent Julia at TPA went above and beyond for my son &amp; I saving us 4 hours of travel time! And she had been working since 3am! Stellar customer service. BIG shout out! 👏👏👏
Hi @Delta! Do you allow long umbrellas in the cabin? If so, do they count toward the carry-on item limit?
@Delta I'm supposed to be flying DL4841to ATL but it's delayed due to maintenance checks from a rough landing - can you assist with rerouting to final destination LHR?
Ugh!! @Delta how could you let boarding complete only to deplane everyone to change out the wheel on the aircraft?! Shouldn’t that have been checked before allowing anyone to board in the first place? On and off ... 3 1/2 hour delay so far and counting!!
@Delta what the fuck?! You guys are so quick to answer the tweet, but cant answer the email. Now I'm being told the bags are in guadeloupe. Are you guys fucking kidding me?
Haven’t received @Delta brag tags since I was Plat 3 years ago. Only my second time getting them as Gold if I remember correctly. What should I do with them? 🤓✈️
@Delta Just boarded our flight from Puerto Rico to ATLANTA and had the worst experience in all my years flying Delta. Flying with a special needs child is always challenging but this experience was the terrible.
@Delta BIG shout out to TPA ticketing agent Julia who’s been working since 3am &amp; who voluntarily re-routed my son &amp; I home arriving to SFO 4 hours earlier👏👏👏 She needs a raise! HNY!
My flight from GSO to ATL is delayed. I’m missing my connecting flight from ATL to BNa...how can I reschedule my connection ?? @Delta
@Delta You are the ones who need assistance. Assistance setting up a proper a call center. Maybe open that tight purse of yours and hire some call center administrators, real ones.
@Delta Hi, she needs to change her return bereavement flight. She has been told she must call the USA number. Can they do the change on the UK number? Thank you again
Had the WORST experience at YYZ today. Everyone uses the luggage ticket printing kiosk. Takes 2 min. Except @Delta. They make you wait for over an hour in line so someone can print it for you. It took longer to check a bag than it did to get through a massive customs line. #slow
@Delta I purchased a FIRST CLASS ticket and have been denied entry into your longue in Detroit because I’m flying to Canada. What gives? I paid over $2K for my ticket. This is unacceptable.
@Delta we've spoken to so many different people and no one knows what is going on. This is the most ridiculous experience I've ever had
@Delta Why would I pay the money for the bags and have them sent back to philly?!?! What is going on with you guys?!?!.
@Delta I am being told the bags were separated. One is in atlanta the other 2 are in miami. Nobody knows why the fuck they cant be put on a plane to get over here. Someone is trying to send it back to philly. I leave tomorrow and the bags are not here.
@Delta please make me understand how I fly to haiti on the 2nd. My bags did not come in. Not only did they not come in on the 3rd. They also did not come in today o the 4th.
@Delta Please see DM I just sent ASAP!
I did everything I could. I speak 3 languages. And yet after 4 months of different assessments and interviews @Delta decides to let me know I didn’t get the job as a flight attendant. What was all that for? Studied everything I could about the company still not good. Lmao. Bet!
@Delta Currently on hold, someone is working on it, but thank you!
@Delta Our friend in the UK needs to book a bereavement flight, could you dm for our contact number? Thank you
@Delta my wife just booked a trip she has a gluten allergy where can I go to make sure she gets a gluten free meal
On hold with @Delta due to flight delay meaning I’ll miss connection. Hold music is currently a banging DnB/jungle type situation.
hey since our flight is delayed can we have a free cocktail @Delta
@Delta is there a change fee to change a flight to earlier in the same day
@Delta DL 1058 11:50 ATL-MCO 01/04/20 Beverage service not provided. Announced”Hope to make it up on future Delta flight”How possible!? No flight issues only bad crew. Un-Medallioned
Hey @Delta I just saw that my bag was not loaded in STL where I checked in two hours before takeoff. I see it will land in Manila on Monday but I will be on another island by then. Can you please tell me how and when I will get my bag????????
@Delta I was charged twice for my flight and I can’t get through to customer service, can you help me?
@Delta DM’d you for help. Could really use it. I’m way too sick to talk on the phone but I will if I need to.
Thank you @Delta Twitter for handling my issue. I was still on hold by the time you took care of me... 🤦🏼‍♀️ I appreciate your help!
@Delta #Delta A quick tip for Delta route planners, From a very seasoned international traveler.. I Would seriously consider being more aggressive In the NEast market. Specif., New Haven (HVN). Currently American has FULL flights going in/out of this location. PLS Consider.
@Delta why in the heck do y’all have options to select your seats and y’all turn around and choose the seats y’all want me and my family to have? That’s stupid
My mom needed her checked bags for medication. After being told by 3 people at TSA and @Delta they could not remove the bags from being sent on to Tally, I spoke to Silvia. She said she would do what she could. She got the bags and had them delivered to my mom.
So an update on my father, today he stood and walked. Has mobility in his left arm again. I guess there is still good in the world. I want to thank the crew and passengers of @Delta flight 1270 on thursday 2 January.
@Delta my company booked a flight for me and my first and middle names are combined on the reservation. How do I change that? Don’t want any issues at the airport
@Delta your customer service workers at JFK 1st floor are RUDE and disrespectful!! Hire new people 😡
@Delta Just flew Delta to CES...can't wait to see the future of travel!
@Delta is there any reason that some of your employees lack understanding, sympathy, and are (passive and active) aggressive? Very disappointing
Hey @Delta my friend left laptop on NY-SFO flight yesterday. She’s getting auto responses - any advice?
@Delta At PHL, Flight 6024 was diverted to BWI due to fog. Getting no answers from GA if 1:34 is still our departure time. They won't tell us if plane has left BWI to come to PHL. Can you PLEASE update? Heading to BOS.
@Delta Flights get delayed it is natural but treating customers like shit is an altogether different thing. I can enlighten more about experience in Oct 2019. I really kept my mouth shut at that time but was surprised at unprofessional behavior.
@Delta rebooked 3 hrs later, with 3 hrs lay over. Honestly rebooking part is not a problem. If the team was aware of pilot sickness they should have updated before time so that people could leave accordingly and if pilot didn’t inform until last minute then this is very unprofessional
@Delta hi! If I send my record locator can someone help me with a seat?
So far it’s been a half hour waiting for “7 minutes” on hold with @Delta 🤔
@Delta understand sickness part but how can he not inform the crew on time and how could the manager/supervisor at Delta not know about it until 6:20 am when time of departure is 6:30 am . Or they knew about it and did not inform the passenger until very last moment.
@Delta Flying from Lax to Sydney in Premium Select - does every row of premium select have same seat recline?
@Delta I arrived at Narita from Manila .A flight attendant cleaning up meal plates dropped a plate on me.After I asked the ground staff abnut cleaning, She said she would give me $ 50 coupon instead of cleaning.But I rarely get on DKL . Is this response the normal?
@Delta be careful with delta. They'll said I thing and do another... miss a flight because gate change . They said no charge for stand by for the next flight ... BANG Credit card was charged for flight
@Delta messed up and didn’t have us on the list for a traveling family. There are no more seats and now the kids are scattered about the plane. Let’s see how this works for the flight attendants and the five year old.
@Delta I understand sickness part but how can he not inform the crew on time and how could the manager/supervisor at Delta not know about it until 6:20 am when time of departure is 6:30 am . Or they knew about it and did not inform the passenger until very last moment.
Anyone or @Delta is 55 mins enough time for a layover to catch a connecting flight 😀😀
@Delta The first experience was in Oct 2019, this is my second incident 1/4/2020. Delay in the flight made worse with a pilot who got sick.
I need assistance for reimbursement asap @Delta
@Delta just want to give a shoutout to the great flight crew on flight DL155. Usually people just have gripes so I wanted to to say “job well done”
@Delta Hi! I will fly on monday from Amsterdam to Phoenix and wanted to book my checked bagage, but could not do it online, only at the airport. Is it not possible to pay/book my bagage online?
Delta Air Lines @Delta think that $200 is an appropriate goodwill gesture for a 5+hour delay in JFK with no information, explanation, instruction, advice, conversation (!), or food, water, refreshment or assistance #insulted #flywithsomeoneelse
@Delta When do MQMs from 2019 rollover?
Well @Delta thank you so much for such a delightful Christmas and New year. I hope you had a better start to this year than me.
I was traveling from New York(JFK) to Detroit (DTW) on Christmas Day via Delta Flight DL5037 and this happened. @Delta #lostluggage #Delta #poorservice
@Delta Why don't you support AwardWallet?
@Delta Fíjate que los vuelos que he hecho en esta oportunidad todos han salido todos con retraso, a excepción del que nos dejó varados aquí en el aeropuerto de Atlanta a mi hija, mi señora y mi persona, creo que no es justificante.
Interesting. @Delta perfectly willing to have me switch preferred carriers over a $197 status issue. This after sticking with Delta out of Philly. Per Customer Care: “Nothing we can do about it”. 🙄 Is Delta actively culling Diamonds?
@Delta I don’t get a TV on my flight :( not fair.
@Delta Waited over an hour to check a bag at YYZ after already checking in from home - missed my flight - brutal! Never again. Terrible service.
@Delta Thank you for offering a possible explanation. I appreciate that.
@Delta Pero si controlar la no partida del vuelo Atlanta - El Salvador 10 minutos fueron la diferencia, soy cliente frecuente de viajes con Ustedes, esperaría una mejor atención en el vuelo de las 5:45PM, pueden revisar su historial y verán mis vuelos con Ustedes.
Just had help from Monet on @Delta and hope Monet is training reps working for my favorite airline because no one better than she.
Thank you @Delta for constantly upgrading me.. I love you 🥂❤️
@Delta thanks again for the awesome service yesterday. Our original flight was going to be delayed leaving SAN and we were going to miss our connect at MSP (last flt of night). Bag check personnel pulled a miracle w/5 min to spare and got us on a Non stop flight to DTW. #grateful
@Delta the third flight in a year with no catering— no food ok but no coffee?? You’re killing me DL700
@Delta preemptively delayed my 12:55pm flight from Binghamton NY to Detroit at 2:30am, screwing me on my connection to Denver. At least I was able to switch my flights in time.
I had my first bad customer service experience with @Delta and I’m really, really disappointed. You guys were my primary carrier and I may have to switch after that.
@Delta Will a phone agent have any more information or the ability to direct me to someone who does?
I don't normally shill for The Man, but thank you @Delta for the super generous compensation for taking a later flight out of JFK! I've been delayed, bumped, and cancelled for a LOT less, i.e. nothing
@Delta DL3785 sat on the tarmac for 30 min upon arrival in ATL causing us to miss our connecting flight to St. Lucia. All we were told was, sorry we can't hold the plane for everyone and then given a hotel voucher. That cost us $450 for tonight at our resort. YOUR fault not ours!
Best experience ever @Delta my 16 year old is traveling alone today and from point A to the last point has been awesome THANK YOU 😊
@Delta It's been pushed back to 8:30 now, however that's nothing more than a guess as it's almost 8:00, and they still haven't been able to access the cabin. This is unacceptable.
@Delta Yes, I know. You'll note they were also tagged in the tweet.
Complicado viajar de Estados Unidos a El Salvador, en época de invierno, hoy perdí vuelo de @Delta Atlanta a El Salvador, porque el vuelo de Durham a Atlanta lo retrasaron por clima, gracias a Dios hay otro vuelo, pero a esperar 7 horas.
@Delta First, you are the most responsive airline I have ever encountered! Thank you! Second, I'm trying to pay for an upgrade and not seeing an option for that in my reservation. Can you help? Thanks.
@Delta Which translates to "Sorry you'll never hear anything further even if we realize that yes there is something strange going on with the website"?
@Delta And when can I expect to hear back from your IT team?
@Delta Hi. Do you know when DL5691 will be departing from San Diego? It's been delayed an hour, and the crew still hasn't been able to access the plane?
@Delta How can customers trust Delta when their phone agents are providing misinformation? Their error has resulted in me having to purchase an additional ticket.
@Delta There's no contact information available for someone who might be able to explain why your website suddenly thinks a route doesn't exist despite your website claiming in another place that the route exists?
@Delta Can you find that information? Or direct me to someone who might have it? Because right now this makes no sense at all and it still seems like your website is messed up based on what I've pointed out.
@Delta Yesterday I arrived at FLL airport at 610PM trying to jump on the 640PM to MSP for a medical emergency. The women at the check in counter got me ticketed, rushed through security and to the gate. I can’t thank you enough 🙏
@Delta I am flying in from NAS to DTW and connecting through ATL. I have an hour connection time, and have to go from E terminal to A terminal. Wanna me out? #KeepFlying #Marcus and #Britney can help 😜🙄
@Delta no Delta staff at STT?
@Delta I already have and you have essentially told me "sorry we can't do anything"
@Delta Ok then please explain WHY there is not service available on that date on that route (which I have flown many times, MCO-DTW-ITH) in spite of their being seats available on both legs of the flight? Because from where I am sitting that makes exactly zero sense.
@Delta Yes I am aware of that seeing as I said it in my first tweet. I am also aware, as I said in a later tweet, that seats are available from MCO-DTW and DTW-ITH on that day on flights that would not result in missed connections. Which does not make sense. At all.
also pretty wild that central @Delta baggage services has no way to get in touch with the baggage service on the ground at an actual airport. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
@Delta It also shows comfort+ as available for at least 9 passengers. So again, either something is weird on your end or you expect me to believe at least 18 people canceled their (apparently standby??) tickets in the last 9 hours.
@Delta I want to order a vegetarian meal for my flights on april 28th and may 13th. When doing this in the Delta app I get a pop up saying "We are unable to process your request".
Thank you @Delta for being soooo accommodating! Your customer service reps are phenomenal! ✨
@Delta No long lines at any other airlines or security. But yes, obviously it was my fault. #insane
@Delta Also this morning it shows main cabin as available (though absurdly overpriced) from ITH-MCO 4/5 and 4/6 for at least 9 passengers (just randomly trying the highest number I can search for) so again, it seems like maybe something is weird on your end.
@Delta But if you look at each leg seperately, MCO-DTW and DTW-ITH there ARE flights, which is why I wonder if something might be wonky on your end. Also last night looking it showed almost the entirety of the main cabin as available on the seat map but not to buy which seems unlikely.
So my @Delta flight from DTW to DCA is outdated with no tv screens. This is ridiculous
@Delta What the heck? I booked a flight with Skymiles I’ve earned and had to cancel and you want to charge me $150 to not fly? That’s ridiculous. I clearly made a mistake when starting a skymiles account. Will be moving to Southwest.
@Delta sky priority bag drop over 45 min wait at MSP this am - not a single delta attendant available either except at counter - finally saw one and he got me over to into baggage line. Counter agent didn’t even greet me. Unacceptable - SM and Delta Sky Member
@Delta And last night the site said there were only 1st class seats available despite the seat map showing a large number of main cabin/comfort+ seats on each flight.
@Delta disappointed that two of your phone agents confirmed a return flight that is now not being honored. I find this unacceptable.
@Delta if you are going to insist we gatecheck our carry on bags, can you at least prioritize getting them up to passengers waiting in the jet bridge in cold locations? Waited 20 mins at MSP in 18 degrees because the crew member forgot to send the lift up with the bags.
@Delta just had a wonderful phone experience with Courtney at your GTS location in Atlanta. She helped me immensely &amp; should be awarded for her amazing customer service skills.
At @Delta gate A9 in #Atl. Asked if we can preboard to avoid tying up boarding as we settle 2 dogs. We've ALWAYS done preboard in the 10 years our dogs have flown. Agent asked if they're service dogs &amp; Ric replied "no, we pay for them fairly.".
@Delta Delta offers great customer service! My favorite airline.
@Delta I was at the airport at the gate in time. But thank you for your help. Maybe staying with Delta isn’t worth the hassle.
@Delta very dissatisfied with the customer service and gate agent for San Jose airport in California. Your policy states that you have to be at the gate 15min before departure. The plane was already leaving by 06:07 with a scheduled time of 06:15. I missed my flight as a result
Top customer service from @Delta 👍🏻
@Delta Melbourne international — I think it’s orkando-Melbourne international formally. Melbourne, fl
@Delta Who can be contacted? We are going back to the airport as this is taking too long.
@Delta my wife and two kids are on an transatlantic international flight and their entertainment systems aren’t working and nobody can seem to help them. What’s up with that?
@Delta I just made Silver Medallion status for the first time ever, what are the chances I get a First Class upgrade on my next flights to CES?!
If you plan on going to #PAXEast2020, check for flights now. My flight with @Delta was super low for a round trip.
@Delta It’s been almost 3 weeks. No word on the lost phone. Can someone assist? We’ve only received a claim number, nothing else.
@Delta you could just add a button to input pre check I’d on your site instead having folks wait in long lines. We are in a digitized world
@Delta Why Aeromexico never follows SkyPriority policies and status earned with Delta? All together, we checked 5 bags with Delta. Aeromexico only allows me 2.
@Delta You know how many people are going to be flying so there is no excuse to not have enough people working. I can see stations unstaffed at the counter. As I said, UNACCEPTABLE!
@Delta Hey Delta Airlines! There is a declared State of Emergency in Australia NSW. I cancelled my flight yesterday and had to pay a fee! What does it take for Delta to wake up! When air clears I’ll book elsewhere!
@Delta UNACCEPTABLE BAGGAGE DROP LINE IN MSP THIS MORNING! I’m not worried about security but I might miss my flight because of baggage drop.
@Delta My son has been waiting for 10 hours for baggage that was not put on his connecting flight. He’s tired and wants to go home. Why couldn’t his bag been delivered to him??......
Hey @Delta, no online check in possible for your flights departing FRA??! Are we in 1995 or 2020? Very inconvenient if you travel with carry-on only. Plus it makes you arrive earlier than necessary at the airport. #delta #deltaairlines #FRA
@Delta Well I’m a happy customer (even though I’ve been sitting on this plan for 45 mintutes! ) On my way to San Fran from Asheville.
Dear @Delta, I don't know if you have bereavement flights but I'm thankful for your frequent flyer miles rewards program. This morning (1am) I used mine to fly my ex up to hopefully see his mother before she passes. Without you it would not have happened. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
@Delta Well we are on the verge of missing our wedding in Punta Cana because It appears you’re not able to handle ice while other planes are taking off around us.
@Delta Worst experience of my life so far for the second time with delta.
@Delta Yeah complete travel bucket but without traveling via Delta if we want peace of mind. Ridiculous customer service, crew members that barely communicate, pilots get sick but they prefer to stay at home and don’t give a sick call until 10 minutes before departure.
told her there are huge lines and they’re understaffed it wasn’t our fault and she was SO rude then finally opened the door and told us to hurry up. Never been treated so rude by a @Delta staff member before. I don’t understand why they decided to take off early??
I just wanna shoutout Ms. Caroline at the @Delta Baggage Services desk are JFK this morning!! She and BLC were tremendous helps with updating me on my bag’s whereabouts &amp; when it should arrive. Whine: my bag’s still in Accra. Cheese: at least it was lost on the way back! 😂
@Delta Third trip in two weeks ATLANTA, NY, San Diego. Rotting fruit stale bagels and generally crappy food at all 3 delta clubs.
Just wanted to give @Delta the biggest shoutout for their incredibly quick, friendly, and effective messaging system. I had ZERO clue I could just TEXT someone about getting a ticket refunded, and it was the most seamless experience I could’ve asked for! Well done👏👏👏
Thanks for the upgrade, @Delta, you made waking up at 3am a little easier...
Hey @Delta it’s very nice that you care about your passengers, but how about thinking in solutions to reduce plastic consumption during flights? One bootle of water per person generates a lot of plastic waste. By the way, great service on the ATL-GRU flight tonight. 🧵
Was just informed I will be placed in an exit row on my upcoming flight. Please pray I assume this responsibility with dignity and a willingness to act if called upon. @Delta
@Delta I'm trying to contact Delta airlines through phone from India. Could you please provide me a 24/7 costumer service number.
@Delta My son bag was left in Minneapolis travelling down to Nashville, he has been waiting at the the airport in Nashville for 6hrs for his bag to arrive, you have not offered any explanation, a hot or cold drink, and have told him, you would not deliver his bag to his address.
How I got to the airport 3 hours before my flight but my bag didn’t make my direct flight I will never know, @Delta...
@Delta And the headphone jack doesn’t work either. #epicfail
@Delta Yes I did. Right when I got to my destination, and my baggage didnt arrive.
Lo acepto. Me encanta viajar con @Delta. Ya lo dije. (tweet no promocionado, lamentablemente :”v)
@Delta So we got to the airport plenty of time yesterday. I sent you a message explaining why your airline has made us have the worst trip ever ! I want to hear back from someone ASAP
Andddd @Delta flight #2 delayed as well. Is this the new normal?
@Delta Already getting awesome service prior to takeoff from Richmond this morning! Hitting the slopes at Big Sky later today! Thank you Delta!
@Delta the buses all say Sky Priority but they may as well say Greyhound- DL 0231 Paris to RDU. We are Business 1st, Delta 1 - but feel like cattle carrying our bags on a packed bus and up the steps. No help, no order.
Hey @Delta - on DL15 FRA-&gt;ATL and wondering how this old equipment is still in use. Worn seats, broken overheads, a PES that is smaller than my thumb. Not your typical form ...
@Delta we neee to do better with the crew waiting
@Delta TY! It is 1 reservation.
About to hop on an 11hr flight, I have a head cold and we just got delayed an hour. I think my @Delta luck has run out #sadday
@Delta what is the number to call for reservation assistance while traveling in Europe? The platinum number I have is an 800#
@Delta Just got off the phone with customer service after 30 minutes and was told to go to the counter for a new boarding pass. The agent told me there's already someone else in that seat. Can you help?
@Delta Hello, if I have an international flight that lands at JFK and I have a connecting flight w/in the US from LGA, what happens to my checked bag? I know obviously I have to transport myself to LGA... thx!!!
.@Delta myself and other passengers on flight DL 095 would like to thank you for losing our bags.
@Delta Thank you. I am actually booked with you for this trip, though the first part is supplied by Virgin Atlantic. I hope the rest is better! Virgin staff spontaneously apologised to me, she was so rude.
@Delta Sworn at by one of your staff at Heathrow. I chuckled, perhaps unkindly, as she pushed past me only to be greeted by the closed door we were all waiting at. Told me to F off and said menacingly “I hope you’re on my flight.”
@Delta Information sent. Thank you for the responses!
@Delta So I am looking for co passenger who is also traveling in the same flight.
@Delta I have return ticket booked for my mother in law who is first time traveling internationally and going back to Mumbai from Vancouver. She will feel confident if she has a company during the flight. Flight is YVR - AMS DL9369 and AMS-BOM DL9494
@Delta Bags were finally delivered to baggage claim. But almost an hour and a half after arrival. Bonus miles? Uber compensation?
@Delta No one ever came out. The response we got at the baggage service center was that maybe bags would be delivered tomorrow
@Delta Wow now there are women with infants crying because they've been waiting nearly 2 hours for pushchairs.... go delta! Youre great!!!
Over an hour to claim a checked bag? Not acceptable @Delta thanks for ruining our plans for the rest of the night
@Delta I’ve been waiting over an hour with a bunch of other lovely people here at SeaTac for our luggage. The 2,500 miles for late baggage isn’t going to cut it this time.......
@Delta How you guys handle this and even care about your passengers. The way in which I was spoken to today will quickly be added as a thread tomorrow.
@Delta Yes, and there is no explanation or apology, apparently you are just a bit crap at being an airline. 20 minute guarantee my arse!
@Delta I’ve seen you guys remove people because they can’t sit in their seat. Through no fault of my own I had to climb over people and incur bruises because I had to sit sideways. I’m pretty sure delta had the right to move them off. I’m so incredibly appalled by
@Delta Rethink prices for India bound flights...
@Delta I climbed over two people who would not move at all. And I was left with approximately 1/4 of my seat
@Delta What is forgot to be mentioned here is that I purchased the same seat as two other people. These two people took up 3 spaces. I bought the 3rd seat and was expected to climb over everyone (two who would not move) and I barely got 1/4 of my comfort plus seat.
@Delta No you are twisting words. They sat down first they would not stand up to get to the window seat when it was my turn to board
@Delta really?! still waiting for nearly an hour an a half for bags in seattle. #shitshow
@Delta You did not assist with absolutely anything. I will make sure I speak to someone who may be better equipped at the job at hand
@Delta It was allowed? This is a ludacris statement at best
@Delta I would believe that retraining would be beneficial. My account from the situation ? I gave you the number. Furthermore if you are over a size 12 you are considered bigger. I reported it and the crew could not help me. Why would you have a place that says
@Delta Only if you increase my credit limit
@Delta The entire flight is waiting for their bags. Not just me. The window has a long line of people waiting already and no one in the immediate area.
@Delta is there a problem at SeaTac with bags? Flight landed 40 min ago and still waiting.
@Delta my name is Lonnie Kelley and I'm 71 with incurable lung cancer. I'm hoping Delta can help me out with a round trip to Seguin Texas to see all my siblings before the cancer takes me. I was told today that the type of cancer I have will take me in4 to 6 months.
My family 3 days stranded in #racist #Johannesburg #Airport #Delta with no explanation except negligent overbooking. MOTHERS AND BABIES sleeping in the airport more than 5days @Delta #ShameOnYou
Thank you @Delta for changing my flights without penalty! I may have lost my upgraded seat but at least now I should make my cruise in time! ❤️
And BTW this is the 3rd time in 2 weeks this has occurred. Delta is calling my name. The service difference between you two is NIGHT and DAY. @Delta you rock
@Delta is there no supervisor at JFK terminal 4?
@Delta I just wanted to give A gate agent, Shaun from Atl, positive feedback. He helped me try and fix a problem that a gate agent informed me. He went above and beyond to reconcile my problem that a precious delta employee improperly told me regarding an upgrade. Atl-icn
@Delta I’m here at JFK with two of your representatives who refuse to send a supervisor down to baggage service.
@Delta can you help me with a partner flight tomorrow on Virgin Australia?
Hi @Delta, I just arrived in DCA about 30 minutes ago from Minneapolis (flight 1776) and realized I left my wallet on the plane. What should I do?
@Delta after informing Emma employee of yours that I was a Gold card holder and asking for further information and assistance as instructed by Travis also an employee. Emma decided to be rude and say she's busy AS IF I WASN'T STANDING IN THE SAME LINE SHE WAS SERVICING. NOT COOL!
@Delta an amazing flight crew tonight from MSP CLE, flight 5084! Flight attendants were attentive, fun and most of all safe! Great team! #loveDL#keepclimbing
i’ve been noticing service has significantly gone down anyways, so this was the final push to truly become a @Delta flyer. I’ll pay the $25 fee because delta has never left my bag before !
@Delta, it’s gonna be a nightmare to stay at the airport for NINE HOURS with a 3 year old boy full of energy. Is there anything you can do to show you care about your customers? Late checkout? Earlier flight?
Hey @Delta, just missed my connecting flight DL105 due to a delay on DL1110. Was sent to a hotel w/ no access to the phone “because we are on Delta” according to hotel staff. I was told to leave the hotel by 11am to catch a flight at 8.44pm..
@Delta Won't ever be complete (too many great places in this world), but always checking things off!
hey @Delta i know most tweets at you are just complaints but i am loving my SLC Sky Club experience tonight! good local beer selection, great staff, tasty snacks, and plenty of space!
If anyone wonders, @Delta sucks if you are disabled, or need to change a flight. Customer service was slow, and not even apologetic about their price gouging. I rebooked with Spirit with insurance, checked bags and more for less than half what Delta wanted to change one trip leg.
Using wifi onboard @Delta DL1837. This tweet originated at 36000 ft above the ground and my mind is blown. 🤯 #technology
Drunk guy in my hotel elevator just turned to a @Delta pilot and said: “Thank you for your service.”
@Delta you might want to have a word with your ground crew at MOB. My duffle came off the baggage claim carousel soaked, like it'd been dropped in a massive puddle. All my belongings inside are soaked. Thanks for making me have to rush to do laundry at a moment's notice.
@Delta hi there Happy New Year
@Delta has been messing up big time lately. I’m grateful for my first class upgrade yesterday but rethinking my loyalty moving forward
Got in 20 min early so I forgive @Delta for my troubles
@Delta I don’t know the tag #. The customer service rep in Ft. Lauderdale thinks she might have found it and that it may be on a flight here in the morning. So, I guess I’ll just wait and see. Sigh.
@Delta Checked one off already!! Thank you for always delivery me and my family safely.
@Delta I'll make one and do it
I will NEVER fly @Delta again! It’s been 24 hours and I still don’t have my luggage.
@Delta I’d like to thank you and recognize Whitney Hubbard, Agnes Kilpatrick and John Ross for their excellent customer service tonight at MSP. They were extremely helpful and represented Delta well!
.@Delta lost my bag coming from Ghana. And the reps are incredibly rude like I lost the bag. 2020 is off to quite a start.
@Delta No worries, no longer Diamond and moved my status to Southwest. Enjoyed my flights on DL but the UM issue made me change. Previously an ACS GM and simple steps that can be taken to improve ops. I would go out of my way to fly DL, why did that change?
@Delta U have the birthdates of my children, (U know they are young!) Bought 4 seats, and tomorrow we will either A) be forced to the back of the plane despite buying upgrades or B) be forced to rely on the kindness of strangers to sit together on our 2+ hour flight. Not cool.
@Delta Happy New Year! I love your brand and would love to find some creative ways to work together. Please send me a direct message. Thanks!
Dear @Delta you always excel. Mistake flying Aanother Aairline with a delayed departure, missed connection, delayed bags and never a kind word all day from a single employee. They are SAAd.
@Delta My friend and I checked in online at the same time for the same flight, he got a seat and I didn't. Why?? we purchased identical tickets.
@Delta 2/2 I was it was an equipment change and there were no more aisle seats in comfort+. I need an aisle seat. I asked for compensation for this change like extra miles &amp; was told you don’t do that. I’d really appreciate being asked in the future not just told. #dobetter
@Delta 1/2 I’m extremely disappointed that my seat on my flight from LGA to ATL this morning was changed without my consent. Because of that, I had to sit in the main cabin after I decided to treat myself to comfort+. Yesterday I called to find out why.
Just made an emergency landing in Atlanta minus a front tire. Full brace/brace protocol. I started laughing when they reminded people that they couldn’t smoke. The people near me think I’m a psychopath. The crew was great. Guess I’m doing the show on Monday. @Delta #Flight1491
@Delta I would but there seems to be a cheaper airline to use with their first class ticket price at your economy set ticket price 🙄
@Delta thanks for the prompt response. Here’s hoping!!!
@Delta wouldn’t mean anything to anyone else, but important cups and souvenirs from our family trip. We were in row 16.
@Delta know this is a longshot, but we just realized we left a Starbucks bag with some important souvenirs on the plane. Flight 2533 from SAN to ATL. is there any hope in getting it back?!
@Delta I was on my honeymoon! And they treated me like I’m a fat white woman who should buy two seats when I’m smaller than the two women in the seat. Then when we went to get off she screamed because people hit her knee. I’m sorry but getting on and off flights is not easy.
@Delta reimburse me for the inconvenience of driving 14 hours to Salt Lake City to pick up my luggage that y’all incorrectly labeled
@Delta any timing problems with the flight connection from BOM to BOS (via JFK)? Flying soon for college and definitely don’t want to miss my flight. 90 minute layover for an international flight seems less.
@Delta really shitty service losing bags. Get it together!
@Delta Nice job. Push back and go to runway and then you park us and tell us we can’t depart for an hour. Should have left us in the comforts of the terminal instead of the confines of a small jet with screaming babies.
@Delta #flight1491 emergency landing here just now in #Atlanta 1 tire blew on takeoff in Tampa. Great job from the pilots but wow. Not fun to Brace,brace, brace! And head down, head down! Old planes need to be replaced Delta!
@Delta Well, I don't want to "complete" it... but making a big deny is part of the plan!
@Delta It's all good, I'll call the Platinum line and bitch someone out.
@Delta A round the world flight?? Can you hook me up?
hey @Delta, I need help changing a flight due to a back injury. I've been having a tough time getting through on customer service.
@Delta please train your crew to depart on time. We are waiting on the black top for these tools to load up - who can I contact about paying for my wasted time?
@Delta Send some sky miles my way for a quick assist 😬👌🏽
My FEMALE PILOT just called my @Delta flight plane SEXY and it made my day. #ladyboss
The fact that @Delta is a comparatively well-rated airline is such a damning indictment of the US flight industry. Like, jesus fucking christ.
@Delta at it again. My flight was supposed to depart at 8:15 and we are still on the runway.
@Delta this was realized after being told we had to wait at the end of the jet way in 28 degree weather while they took drink orders of first class
Shout out to @Delta for moving me into an extended leg room seat! This 5'1.5" person is super thankful! #shortpeople #legroom
Two @Delta employees checked their system in Dallas to make sure our bags were on our next flight and we arrive in LAX without bags. Ridiculous.
@Delta I raced to the gate in CDG as they were boarding. But wow. Air France in Bilbao had only 2 people working. The same people at the gate were the same people at baggage checkin. They were the slowest ever.
@Delta FF here flying from SJD to LAX tomorrow with only 1 seat assignment for 5 pp including a 2 yo, 7 and 9. Please help getting seats together. Thank you!
@Delta However, in contrast, the rest of us in Comfort Plus were treated to amazing service.
@Delta When we needed something we asked for it, not the normal above and beyond service we have grown accustomed to.
.@Delta Just got off the phone with Micaela - please tell her thank you for the tremendous assistance and customer support she provided.
@Delta obviously you don't support our Military. Shame on you. My nephew gets deployed, he had a ticket to come home next week but you don't give a refund for the ticket, really??? #deltastinks
@Delta Traveled today on DL2376 with my wife &amp; 3 kids. Very impressed with the flight crew. Due to some turbulence, my kids were a bit frightened. The cabin crew, particularly Sara, was extremely attentive and kind to them which greatly helped. Great customer service!
@Delta y’all never leave on time.
@Delta and I shall be completely regarding if I ever fly with them again!
@Delta I filled out a claim for my case and have tried emailing them and nearly 3 weeks later have heard absolutely nothing from them! Complete lack of urgency and being efficient with dealing with complaints. I am not happy with the customer service provided by delta
@Delta Idk. Seems like you just need a larger bucket! The list is growing...
@Delta complain to which no one could be bothered to help me with the attitude of people that quite clearly couldn’t care less. I understand people have bad days and don’t always know what’s going on but I paid for a flight a lot I might add for terrible service and customer care
God bless the woman on DL2351 that moved my tall ass up to the exit row. @Delta her name is Thea. She’s wonderful.
@Delta More direct flights from San Diego 2020!
@Delta .. he then forced the Handle to my case down closed keeping in mind this case is antler and not even a year old. I get to JFK to pick up my luggage to find it’s cracked with the wheel also missing and the handle now not able to come up. I went straight to customer desk to
Had the worst experience flying with @Delta over the Christmas period and I’ll explain why. Arrived in New York after flying from Sydney on the 18th of December. Landed in LA and picked up my cases to transit through and my case was fine but I did explain the handle didn’t go
@Delta Juan Rodriguez who works down in the immigration/customs area for Delta at Hartfield Jackson Atlanta airport was a TREMNDOUS help just a few minutes ago!! He gave EXCELLENT customer service!!
@Delta Thank you for the prompt reply. What can I do to follow up on this to make sure that it gets back to me? Phone #'s, email addresses, etc.?
@Delta how is is that this flight to Daytona always gets delayed for whatever secret reason #Delta Plane is not even full. Makes us wonder if you are waiting to fill the plane by waiting for standby passengers
Thank you @Delta and the crew of flight DL2358 today from West Palm to LGA! Flight was bumpy but you guys are awesome for keeping everyone calm. Looking forward to our next trip! 😊🙏
@Delta What do you mean? I have the Delta Reserve AmEx... is that enough?
@Delta Left my iPad on plane in AUS on 12/30/19. My locator app showed it in your lost &amp; found in ATL that evening. I have filled out form &amp; updated it many times. Now it is at the UPS facility on Marvin Miller Dr. in Atlanta. No one will tell me anything. Where is it going?
@Delta Is it not possible to stream netflix while in the air? I keep getting the following error code: M7037-1101 // I am assuming this has to do with the DL speed?
@Delta My bucket list includes a Delta One seat on a flight. To anywhere.
@Delta I’m flying into Atlanta and my husband is going to get in an hour or so after me. Can I access the Sky Club *after* landing to hang out while I wait for him?
@Delta Just need 120,000 more delta SkyMiles 😭
Delays, plane broke, gates reassigned and @Delta handled it with class, compassion, and awesomeness. Two 👍 up delta!
@Delta just flew us around our destination of Knoxville for 30 minutes only to send us back to Atlanta. We were delayed from ATL then They knew there was limited to no visibility when we took off but decided to take off anyways. I’m not a happy skymiles member right now.
After obvious maintenance issues our direct, 4h morning flight from Cincinnati got canceled. Alternative took us over 2 stops, 10h+, and our suitcase is on a different plane, delayed again. @Delta you suck and just made it to my no flight zone.
@Delta I tried yesterday and today at the gate, but seems that few extra $ is more important then keeping families together for Delta.
@Delta can't wait to see you for the first time this year.
Do you do this to your customers @Delta?
@Delta left my gate-checked bags at the gate. Forgot to actually put them on the plane. Unbelievable.
@Delta I pay to upgrade seats and you don’t assign the other person in my party to the seat right next to me nor let me choose? 🤷🏼‍♀️ And I’ve been on hold for 29 minutes trying to fix this!
@Delta check your uniforms for Dupont #Pfas ..that poisoning the world and could be what causing the problems with the uniform..scotchgard!!!
@Delta missing a connecting flight because of this airlines irresponsibility sucks!!! The worst part is that they don’t even apologize #neverflydeltaagain
I had one of the BEST in flight crew members today on DL3634, MEM —&gt; MSP! Whomever the 1st class attendant was (1/2/2020) thank you! @Delta she was incredible &amp; you should strive for all of your flight attendants to be as attentive, polite &amp; courteous as she was! #thankyou #delta
Hey @Delta do you offer Bereavement Flights for military spouse's?
@Delta hi how can I add my TSA pre check info to a booked flight?
@Delta Yeah after I wait on line at the DMV for 365 days just to get the new license 🙄
@Delta if someone is throwing up pre-flight how do you let them on the plane??? Ridiculous!!! 😡😡😡😡
@Delta I hope you find my interview malfunction endearing instead of seeing me as a total screw up 😊
@Delta Yes, the ATL-JFK flight is on Delta and the Virgin ticket was also booked as an award through Delta. Thx
@Delta do my MQMs and/or MQDs carryover for this year? They aren’t showing up...
@Delta Yes and I was told that only 20% of the value of my items would be reimbursed
@Delta, we are flying from ATL to JFK on ticket and then connecting from JFK to BOM on a Delta award ticket with Virgin Atlantic. Will we be able to check our luggage all the way through from Atlanta to Mumbai outbound and then Mumbai to Atlanta on the return?
either @Delta or the Minot Airport is a joke. either way, i’m pissed.
Thanks @Delta for your shameful silence
And at gate 40! minutes before sked arrival. Another great @Delta experience. Great crew as well.
@Delta Hi there! I love Delta and just missed Gold status last year. I knew I’d still be Silver this year but was shocked to see no roll over MQMs on my account. What happened?
So @Delta found my luggage but it was DRIPPING wet with water #SoMad
@Delta You Purchased KWD 133.26 at DELTA via internet on card 479045xxxxxx0629. Avail limit KWD 866.74. KFH#1803333 . This is the message from the bank it shows the deduction
Wow I can’t believe @Delta lost my bag and legit can’t find it well I guess this is my punishment for trying to catch an early flight 🙄 #SOMAD
@Delta upgrade was deduct from our account so please respond to us immediately to solve this problem
@Delta hi my name is Yousif Alkandari I’m traveling by delta in 7th of January with my friend khaled Alshaya from jfk New York to IAH airport in main cabin seats we made an upgrade to first but there was an error which means it didn’t complete at the same time the amount of the
@Delta Yes, waiting for a call back. Estimated at 45 minutes. But at least I will have someone’s attention for an easy change.
@Delta Gate agent for flight DL1435 from DFW to DTW was just extremely rude to my family saying he couldn’t seat my 7 year old daughter with 1 of her parents. Totally unhelpful and rude and made my daughter extremely nervous to be sitting next to a stranger. Totally unacceptable
@Delta so disappointed to get flight scams in nyc from your flight attendant.
Never, ever use #DeltaAirlines messaging to change a reservation. I was messaging for an hour and it still hasn’t gotten done. Go for a live voice everytime! The agent doesn’t even read the first message. @Delta
@Delta You're awesome, and By far my Favorite airline. 👍✈️
@Delta Why do you penalize your partner airlines on this? I have a SkyMiles account but usual have my VS Flying Club number on my booking - it apparently makes me ineligible 🤷‍♂️
If I had any other option, I would never fly with @Delta again. Time after time, consistent disappointing and rude customer service. Thanks for making flying with a toddler worse than it already is. Jerks. #rantover
@Delta Yes but having to wait an hour &amp; 7 mins for a call back to see if i can get a more helpful rep. 🤦🏽‍♀️ 3rd call today hr + wait each time
Another 3rd class customer @Delta flight. Looking forward to having the $$$$$ to fly first class and then won’t have to deal with insecurity anymore either.
@Delta lost my kids car seat... been sitting here waiting for almost an hour while they locate it... 🙃
Ugh just dealt with the rudest @Delta rep trying to change my parents flight for my nephews BMT graduation 🤬
@Delta I’m headed to Tokyo on the 13th for the second time in a year on Delta. I love how easy the flight is and always try to fly Delta for leisure or work.
@Delta And I’m sorry you won’t receive any more of my business. I’ll let your tweets explain to half of my family why their flights to Disney cost more than the other half. Embarrassing customer service
@Delta need more staff at Skyharbor PHX baggage drop. Only 1 worker on general (non-special, non-sky priority) and line is to the door about 30-45 min wait
Hate @Delta. Horrible customer service. Will be canceling my card and Sky miles account
Um @Delta .... GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF GHANA. This is ridiculous
@Delta First your technicians overfuel the plane because they were in a rush to take off, then you make us sit on the tarmac for 2+ hrs, then you make us stand in a 100 person line w/ only 2 agents to rebook, and after all that no voucher??? Unbelievable.
@Delta I understand fare changes. In a 5 minute span just after I booked the first set and hung up with an agent who suggested that I book two separate online seems a bit sketchy. I’d love some assistance on this. Or even better, to honor the price I was charged for the other booking.
@Delta I missed gold status by just a bit but will get it this year!
@Delta really needs to change their same day confirmed policy. You'd figure being a platinum they'd be willing to put me on a direct flight home instead of making me connect through Atlanta and getting home 4 hours later. You used to be able to do this, but yet another money grab
Ok @Delta whomever came up with “the first step to connection is departure” is a winner.
@Delta Active and military are first to board on delta flights
@Delta no on-board or gate assistance for customers delayed by Delta with connecting #Delta Flight.
@Delta They also exceeded your 20 minute bag guarantee...
@Delta Thank you. You have made my ENTIRE year &amp; the year just began. Thank you thank thank you.
@Delta It's not even the length of time. It's the lengths to which I had to go to have this taken seriously. Especially given my concerns I mentioned in my last tweet in this thread.
@Delta Working hard? We sat for 1 hour waiting on 2 trays of food. You hold up 200 people so 2 people in first class can have lunch?
@Delta I spoke with someone and they had now after 3 phone calls resolved my issue.
@Delta lost my dog. On hold 55 minutes...
@Delta do I have to also complain here to get your attention on the worst travel experience of my life? No response from your customer service reps after 2 days. And to top it off you called at midnight last night saying you would try to deliver my lost bag 2am? #boycottDelta
@Delta Thanks SO much! My hubby and I are flying for the FIRST time on the 7th!
@Delta - I thought Sky Priority bags were meant to be the first on the belt? Seems that's not the case for DL19...
@Delta waiting for over 40 mins for someone to take us via wheelchair through TSA. I have a cat and it’s going to take us longer. We told the wheelchair folks and still no one here to take us. Really hoping we won’t miss our flight. Why does this always happen?
@Delta I think it's time you eliminated the games from the video screens in the headrests. Spent an entire flight with the guy behind me jabbing his finger into my head. #dobetter #CommonSense
@Delta it seriously takes 1.5 hours to talk to a representative about a reservation another one of your representatives screwed up?!? Unreal
@Delta If my luggage (which I plan to check) has a disappearing handle does this have to be considered when measuring the bag?
Very disappointed with @Delta. Lost my luggage and only reimbursed me for half of my necessities. I’ve flown 62,000 miles with them in the past 6 months, guess it’s time to switch companies.
@Delta Hi, is there someone I can contact about my skymiles status? I’ve been platinum for many years and wondering why I didn’t make gold this year. Thank you!
@Delta My baggage went missing during in Amsterdam. I was connecting from Amsterdam &gt; JFK &gt; Orlando. My baggage didn't arrive in New York, I reported it in Orlando In January 1st. It still hasn't been delivered and I'm unable to track it online.
@Delta Thank you! I just spoke with Misty in the call service center and she was extremely helpful (although the call dropped at the end). Kudos to her and thank you for your response!
@Delta Traveling to London on Delta in February, but my dream destination is Tokyo and Kanagawa.
@Delta I am thinking about applying for the gold credit card. If approved do I need to physically have and activate the card before I can get the free checked bags benefit?
@Delta any reason why fares would change half way through booking our big group?! Called for help and agent said we could just split and book into two groups online. Didn’t realize by the time we got to the remaining tickets prices would go up?! Super frustrating. 👎🏼😡
@Delta Well done for being the world’s 3rd most punctual airline as well as being the US’ most punctual airline in 2019!!!
Traveling with @Delta has been the worst traveling experience I’ve had. Currently delayed on my flight 45 minutes and counting because of YOUR staffing issue. Apparently 2 people are more important than the rest of your customers. None of us will be flying delta again if possible
Wow. @Delta is really out here charging an extra $40 for a window seat
@Delta Idk. My bucket list is very long and ambitious 🤣 here’s to trying to knock some things off of it though! 🥂
@Delta I keep being redirected to a login screen when I try to view my Delta profile.
@Delta Suck my dick, automated response. Invest in some real employees you big giant bag of multiple smaller of bags of shit. What sort of the effort would I get from the delta Twitter service guy, assuming they get paid a fraction of your dipshit help-desk attendants? Honestly curious.
@Delta My only concern is our connecting flight at 9:30 out of Atlanta to Cle. If we’re delayed and miss it will it just be rebooked?
So I literally just paid @Delta $100 for my bag only being 10lbs overweight. Then they move these drunk ladies next to me before take off and one of them spilled ranch on me. Never again Delta. 😐
@Delta flight 918 arrived at NAS an hour ago and we are still sitting on the runway in a hot plane. Insane.
@Delta Which aircraft have onboard espresso machines? Only the flagship?
I opted for a window seat so I could get a view of Tampa St Pete from the air, but 22F has no window! @Delta #bummer #B757 #fooled Need better seatmap disclosure!
@Delta No worries for now we’re on that plane for the 6:40 flight out of Miami just making sure we are all behind
Shout out to @Delta Every time we fly Delta accommodates our large family so we sit together. Now they do it without even asking which is great. It takes some of the stress of flying across the country with kids. Keep it up! #FamilyFriendly
@Delta Thanks! It should be a very good year since I'll likely hit my million miler. Who do I see about a cake or something? Or a flight with Ed... That would be cool too 😊
@Delta Headed to Australia next week!
.@Delta served complimentary bellinis on the way out of Amsterdam. I was floored. And the food was...better. Or at least served a lot more stylishly. Begrudgingly impressed so far.
@Delta won’t allow me to change my email address and I can’t get confirmations. Help!!!
@Delta hi any update on the flight DL2025?
✅ book first vacation w gf in years ✅ decide to switch to @Delta w a status match ✅ get sick the night before ✅ sleep 0 hours ✅ Delta loses my bag tfw when tn we’ll be in the jungle two hours from an airport without clothes 👌🏼☺️
@Delta Rationally I know this, but I’m still going to check back a few times a day just because
@Delta Was the first officer delayed again? Went from 1:37 to 4:10 and now 5:00.....NOT due to weather or act of God, but a staffing issue. When does she/he arrive now, and when does the rest of the crew start timing out?
@Delta Lausania on my flight DL 535 to Cancun on 2nd of January 2020 was amazing. Hospitality at it's best. Kind, caring, empathetic, firm and beautiful. Kudos. Thank you for your professionalism and kindness. What a great way to start my year.
@Delta does my MQMs roll over?
@Delta 2 of 2: ...could do and we would need to ask a passenger on the plane to switch with us. There has to be a better way for you to assign seats especially when families book together and you know how old each member of the group is.
@Delta I submitted docs on Dec 18 for my service dog to travel with me on my upcoming flights this Tues (Jan 7) and have not yet received a confirmation email - usually I get one back within a week. Could someone pls check this out? Just want to make sure things got received,Thx!
@Delta hey y’all. I need some help 🥰
@Delta: 1 of 2: Booked tix mos ago and when seats were assigned, you placed my 2 infants together but my wife and I in 2 other rows? At tix counter, were told the gate would take care of it and that they wouldn’t separate a family. At the gate, were told there was nothing they...
@Delta hi Delta - is there a non-800 number that can be direct dialed from outside the USA? I'm in Cape Verde and need to speak w/a DL rep - messaging didn't help
@Delta still hoping you can help, been trying to cancel flight, now less than an hr before takeoff, already sent DM.🤞
On a @Delta flight from HPN to ATL. They overfueled so now we are sitting here in the plane burning fuel before take off. Nearly 2 hours late and counting.
@Delta how difficult is it to get the plane to the gate???? WTF!!!!
@Delta Can you assist w/ the MQMs that should’ve accrued for my SEA&gt;SNA flight, which would’ve given me Medallion Status for 2020? I’ve emailed w/ customer care, spent hours on the phone w/ specific dept &amp; told Nigel will need to assist. Should’ve heard from him Tues.
17 min until 1 hr delay @Delta but last time I was 5 min late I was put on stand by .any one know my rights flight DL782.
@Delta I doubt it. My travel bucket list is very extensive.
@Delta Not to rain on the parade, but let's don't underestimate just how long my travel bucket list is... Only 365 days in the year 🙂
@Delta can you please help me with a flight I can't change online?
@Delta I hope I don't complete the list in 2020. I plan on being around longer than that. Love Delta, it's the best.
@Delta i need you to DM me so I can have a customer rep call me. DL759 seat 5C ASAP
.@Delta is by far the best airline and it’s not even close. American wanted to charge me $64 to sit in a window seat 😵
@Delta I am a travel agent and inquiring for clients who just got off American Duchess today. I will let them know to talk to an agent . thank you
@Delta You should be more transparent about bags rerouting on direct next flight even if you have to rebook on a later flight after the ones bags are on. This causes undue stress.
I just have to say s/o to @Delta for helping me adjust my flight after my plans got moved #ClassicArmy #ThxObama Seriously such a great help from an awesome airline! #ThxDelta Looking forward to seeing friends and family when I get home!
@Delta Impossible! The travel bucket list never ends 😁
@Delta when will rollover miles be posted. I was between silver and gold with Gold Status due to spending.
@Delta 2nd batch on carousel and ours still show on plane. Now over an hour.
@Delta I can only hope to find my way to Spain this year.
@Delta so i go through Delta customer care for compensation for the horrific travel experience on 12/31. I lost 4 hours including incredibly uncomfortable flight from NYC to St. Louis. I was offered a $25 voucher or 3000 miles. so my time and frustration is worth $6.25 hr
Y’all have me waiting at the airport for 6 hours without explanation , Never using this airline again yo @Delta
@Delta yes just need somewhere for them to sit
@Delta what is up with Luggage operations at Atlanta today? Waiting almost 1 hour for 3 bags. Flight 902 SJO to ATL. Total failure
@Delta Not with you. Not after 6 late flights, nasty flight attendants and well crappy service. I think I will complete my list elsewhere
@Delta Have a client with mobility issues at MSY and can not check bags for another hour and no where to sit. Can you help.
@Delta I’m in Vegas blaring flight 2066 and Marilyn was rockin and rollin the boarding process on our delayed flight! Made my morning!
@Delta Your employees, Jana and Courtney, at ORF airport are awesome. With their help, they have ensured I will be able to make it back home. Thank you ladies for wonderful hospitality!
@Delta Hmm I'm not sure that it is. I've tried 2 different flights after doing that. Same Problem
First flight of 2020 and @Delta thoughtfully downgrades me from 3B to 10B. 😞
@Delta hi! What is the playinum phone number for customer service calling from abroad?
@Delta I don't depart ATL until 4:09. Your response is not appreciated. I will address with local resources at the airport. There is no reason for my bag to have already been sent.
@Delta Why was it not placed on MY flight that I rescheduled well in advance??
@Delta I just booked an itinerary but forgot to include my company's rewards program code in - can we get this updated?
@Delta So, how do we know none of the other crew won’t time out? Bummer about meal service, being with the delay we now fall within the meal time window and have been here since 11:30am, as advised due to holiday traffic.
😭 @Delta can you give me the price I saw on Sunday?😢
@Delta Don't try to patronize me, I flew Delta One from LOS to JFK, your Comfort + makes no difference from your Basic Economy. If this is your best response to my complaint then it tells alot about your services
@Delta Taking another trip to Johannesburg next April.
@Delta What’s up with DL1807? Three hour delay? It’s at the gate. Also, will there now be meal service in first, since we’re now flying during normal meal service time?
@Delta had a horrible experience with baggage service at GSP. Agent was rude, on her cell phone the whole time and didn’t even check if the bags I took were indeed mine. That’s not how a medallion member should be treated after a day of delays.
@Delta I am using Google Pixel 2XL with Android; however, multiple people on the flight had their app showing 1:00, and they were using iOS and Android. Even the captain made an announcement apologizing for the miscommunication.
@Delta Well it's too late for all that, I don't think anyone in my shoes would feel comfortable knowing I still have to seat for another 3 hours of flight time. Worse part is we haven't even left and only God knows when we will actually leave
@Delta hi there! On my flight back from SLC (DL832) on Dec 20 I upgraded to Delta Comfort, but I can't find the receipt. I was also using my FlyingBlue, not Delta, number. Is there any way you all can help me out?
@Delta This is BS! Called customer service and said we should’ve been compensated by now! Unacceptable! Now they gave me a DIFFERENT number to call! 🤬🤬🤬
@Delta what if the only thing on my travel bucket list is to fly LAX-IAH nonstop on Delta on a shiny A221? 😎
@Delta what is the link for giving credit for someone’s outstanding assistance?
@Delta I'm 6 feet 2 inches tall, imagine me seating in a middle seat for over 2 hours. How would you feel if that was you? Just think about it. This wasn't the experience I envisioned when booking my flights
@Delta I pay $30 to have one of my bags checked. I then get to the gate where they ate offering anyone who didn’t have a bag checked to have it checked for free... can I have a refund then 🙄
@Delta how do you not have a pilot for a flight????
@Delta Trying to hop a ride to Tokyo in March with you guys 🙌🏽
@Delta when can we expect our flight vouchers for upgrading to the delta platinum card? I do not see anything in my delta application profile. Thank you Dave
@Delta nice customer service. Cancel flights/rebook in MSY and leave no customer service reps on this side of security🤬
@Delta offering cups of water like it's supposed to make passengers feel better.
@Delta What was causing the issue with the app?
Hey @Delta if I book a flight now, can I add a KTN to the reservation after the fact in a few days and still get PreCheck benefits?
@Delta Last thing I needed after an 11 hours flight is to be seated in a tight space for another 2 hours while the crew awaits the fuel tanker. This is appalling
@Delta is your online purchase system down? Transaction loading for 15mins
Hey @Delta thanks for not getting my golf clubs again when I need them for my training session tonight. You had over an hour after changing my flight to get them on the plane. Double fail today
People say a lot of bad stuff about @Delta but I just had the most pleasant interaction with a rep on the phone. Actually made a bad day a little better.

@Delta I might not complete my list, but I'm certainly crossing items off.
@Delta With your amazing gift for volunteering my seat, it sure is! Thanks delta!!!
@Delta do better. We’ve been delayed in Atlanta for almost 2 hours! They told us we didn’t have a pilot or flight attendants 😡
Gracias por su ayuda y atención 🙏🏽🎉 @Delta
@Delta I am trying to book a flight and my name keeps coming up wrong. I have changed my profile and submitted my passport but it did not change my name in my ticket. Peggy Alwilda West Watson is my correct name and the ticket comes up Peggy A Watson. I need help 928-706-0848.
@Delta this flight #1496- super scary turbulence over Lake Michigan! Also, so gross- there was a big ant that crawled over the headrest as I was watching ‘It Chapter 2’ - double unpleasantness
They took a picture of dog to give to manager. We asked for manager to come out &amp; meet her to determine temperament. Nevermind she’s flown @Delta before. Nvmnd she was licking &amp; loving nearby passengers &amp; delta employees. She’s wildly friendly &amp; knew manager would see that
Extremely disappointed in @Delta for not offering closed captioning on their in flight entertainment.
@Delta ...and NOTHING has changed with your boarding order. 1. Snowbirds 2. 1st class/Diamond (should be 1st, it’s in the name) 3. Active Military (should be 1st if you really cared) 4. Families with strollers (holding up jet bridge) 5. Comfort+ 6. 85% of all passengers
Really poor customer service by @Delta today flying from New Orleans to Atlanta regarding my carry on with a flight that is already delayed and a layover that is extremely short because of the delay. Do better. #neveragain
@Delta I am a loyal Gold Medallion member and my #skymiles account has been compromised and merged with another for MONTHS now with no resolution. Please contact me to resolve this security issue immediately. #delta #skymiles
@Delta Definitely! But not with your airline after I was treated poorly a month ago en route to Paris Just booked with American lol
@Delta I've already booked the 4:00 flight because it had Comfort+, and the 3:00 flight only had main cabin with a note that any drop in level wouldn't give any credit. And arriving at 1:56 means departing at 1:00; yet the flight crew is saying we are departing earlier than that
Our @Delta flight to Atlanta diverted to Tennessee. I know you're asking: is that a Chattanooga flew-through? *ducks the flying tomatoes*
@Delta: What is a "file reference number" for a new online buggage damage claim? Is this the same as the baggage receipt number? I have never filed a claim before.
mfs got $3,500 of drip on just to sit in @Delta Basic.
@Delta Yah hook me up with free flights then I can sense it too
We pleaded and argued. My boyfriend is a US Veteran with a service dog for his injuries FROM military. Completely surprised by @Delta behavior especially as Federal government ruled in favor disallowing breed restrictions
I am a military veteran with a disability @Delta This is how you feel about us?! I gave you all the proper paperwork but that doesn’t matter huh smh #DeltaAirlinesSucks
@Delta I was, but then you just completely reset my #SkyMiles medallion status to 0 on 1 Jan being 1 MQS away from Silver. Worst frequent flier program of ANY airline! #BeBetter, Delta.
We called ahead and gave all pertinent paperwork. @Delta was per usual, accommodating on phone. Never said anything on breed restrictions etc. We get to the airport and they won’t let her on. She’s a lab/Staffordshire mix. (Cont)
@Delta Looking forward to my next Delta flight to The Netherlands in April!
At DFW airport. Appalled by @Delta treatment. I have platinum status and fly regularly. Truly love the airline. My boyfriend is flying with me and has his service animal with him (cont).
@Delta literally just denied my service dog and I entrance on our flight just because she looks like a pit bull. Really?! In 2020 we’re still this ignorant Delta?! Every associate behind your desk said she’s the most well behaved service dog they’ve seen but hey policy is policy
@Delta Flight 326 sat at the gate loaded and ready to go for 1hour waiting on Gate Gourmet to deliver 2 meals. Really?????? Exactly where is the efficiency in this? It’s a 3.5hr flight, people won’t starve. Give the 2 bags of pretzels
@Delta I’ve already arrived at the final destination and had to leave for my hotel.
@Delta If I had the money...no doubt
@Delta Complete? No. But crossing off a couple more countries. 👍🏾
@Delta I want to change my flight on Sunday 01/05 due to work conflict and am unable in the app.
@Delta To be clear, I’ve had itineraries to Africa that were less difficult than getting to upstate New York.
@Delta Or at least continue it 😁
@Delta This is an error. App said departing at 1:00; crew says we are departing ASAP, and I have already rebooked my flight. Please get your communications correct because this is causing issues.
@Delta Oh yea you got flights to Antarctica and galopogos with no connections ?
@Delta Thank you! It’s all good, it was still nice, but thanks for letting them know, too :)
@Delta had a fantastic flight from JFK to DCA last night (flight 1449 2nd Jan) the pilots made my daughters year so far (granted only a couple of days in, but still). Please thank them from me as they showed her the cockpit. Superb service and now I’m a delta fan for life.
Hey @Delta! Love the creativity of your safety videos! Has there been any thought on showing passengers how to cover their mouth when coughing? I think it'd really take it to the next level.
@Delta you wanna pay for my tickets?
@Delta I did last night I answered or where else?
@Delta Not happy about my recent experience. I’ve been loyal to you ... why you gotta play me like this?
@Delta I already have my gift card ready to book the next flight.
@Delta Oh come on Delta is it ever complete? Go to one cool location and add 3 more. 😂😂
@Delta All I’m trying to do is change my families flight, and we’re only leaving one day earlier. yet $DAL wants another 600 bucks for the three of us. How is this when flight doesn’t leave until February?! #2020resolutions
@Delta Well, spoke too soon. Now not leaving CHA until 1:00PM. Ugh
@Delta I probably could have rowed myself to France in a row boat faster than I’m going between the Midwest and upstate New York, but thanks for the offer of help.
@Delta It probably won't be the year I complete my bucket list but it WILL be the year I cross the threshold to Million Miler. 😀✈️#DeltaFan
@Delta my travel bucket list is never ending soooo that’s impossible 😂🤣
@Delta I finally got through to someone who was super helpful. Just insane that it took 53 minutes to reach them.
Another great travel experience with @Delta! Big thank you to the gate agents and flight crew who took care of me and everyone else on DL 2739 last night.
@Delta Getting drafted to see Iran? 😂
@Delta I’ll never complete it! There’s always somewhere to go! Flying with you all today from La Guardia to Fort Myers!
@Delta talk about a rough morning. Pilot aborted takeoff because of wind, yet all other flights were? Now I'm on different flights, arriving 5 hours late. Almost missed my rebooked flight in Atlanta too. Not fun.
@Delta how do you not fill up a plane before takeoff? Our plane couldn't go in a BRIEF holding pattern because you didn't fill up. #Negligent will not fly #Delta again. This has lost us a day of travel because you didn't fuel up.
@Delta You wanna donate some Skymiles to this loyal member? 🙃
We had a super flight on @Delta on New Year's Day from HOU to ATL. FA Debbie was kind, funny &amp; a genuine pleasure. The passenger next to me even commented, unprompted, on how great Debbie was. My little was so taken with Debbie. What a great way to start the year Delta Airlines!
@Delta I just saw an Uplift piece about your program to help children with autism and their families practice for their big travel days. Thank you so much and Bravo, Delta!
@Delta 45 min later, I’m still waiting to speak with a reservation agent... so frustrating.
Just want to commend the @Delta gate agents at B6 in CVG for being true champs. They have been so helpful and informative during a long flight delay, even bringing us snacks and lunch.
@Delta Thanks for the flights to London for 30,000 Skymiles! ❤️❤️😁😁
@Delta I sense that you will never be responding to my message—the one y’all requested. 😴
@Delta You giving me free flights? 😬
@Delta It really is... sadly I had to book with another carrier for the first time in years last week. It pained me. 😫
Just booked my ticket to Savannah on @Delta 😁😁😁 so excited to see some old friends ❤️
@Delta It's delayed! Thank you!! I should be able to make the connection!!
@Delta Need some help, have an unaccompanied minor on DL 2314 who is going to miss his connection. In the dark as to what is happening and what his connection to DTW will be
@Delta any chance of a delay of DL2494 from ATL to FLL? My CHA flight is delayed due to ATL grounding/weather. I am going to have a seriously short layover. Any help?
@Delta hola!! Mañana viajo a Miami desde NY, tengo una duda... cuales son los bolsos de mano? Yo siempre viajo con una maleta en cabina y una mochila. Les agradeceré puedan responder mi duda. Gracias
@Delta if my flight is delayed whi do I have to accept and book it as a new flight - I have 20 mins in ATL
@Delta your airplane ran out of fuel on that long 43 minute ride from be CAE to ATL &amp; couldn't wait for clearance to land. We've now missed non stop flight to Hawaii (work trip). No guarantee my husband and I will sit together , lost a non stop flight from ATL and land 6 hrs late
@Delta my favorite airline ever. i love using delta airlines for my trips
@Delta I bought a delta flight operated by AirFrance. Delta is asking me to check in via AirFrance. Their site tells me I am already checked in even though I am not. I call AirFrance which is being very very rude and apparently no one can help! Can delta please do something?
@Delta It's true....Alaska is this year. Cross another location off the list.
@Delta On American if you can believe that
@Delta This seems sort of trivial w everything else going on in my Twitter TL. (?)
@Delta help our bags are not on our flight
@Delta I’ve missed my connecting flight due to the gross miscommunication and am extremely uncomfortable with booking with delta in the future to avoid further unprofessionalism.
@Delta That may be true, but my travel bucket list won’t be completed on your airline, since you won’t allow my Medical Alert &amp; Mobility Service Dog on board 😢
@Delta Whole new meaning to I buy, you fly 😆😉
@Delta Greece 🇬🇷 is the word ❤️ 🛫
This has been the most disappointing @Delta flight with zero communication between pilots, gate agents, and flight attendants
@Delta Hopefully flying to London this summer With you guys 🙏
@Delta D8MHGZ is our confirmation number. We had issues checking in on our way to Edinburgh and anticipate the same struggles.
@Delta Just gotta get through this weather in Atlanta first. 😅
@Delta Is it just me or is this kind of morbid? Also, y’all don’t want to sell any more tickets to us after 2020?
@Delta Girl do you not see what's happening in Iran?!
@Delta This July, going to the Just Four Laughs comedy festival in Montreal - flying Delta ;-)
@Delta I went to sleep during a flight and woke up to one of each snack on my tray, that’s why y’all are the GOAT
@Delta Just booked fights to Rome! Can’t wait ans great prices!!!
@Delta What’s you cancellation guide on WW3?
@Delta Since WW3 seems to be starting this makes sense
@Delta Sure, if you are offering me plane tickets.
So my friend is trying to get on a flight for a very serious emergency, and he gets to the @Delta counter at Medford (on time) and no one is at the counter. He tries to get help, can't, goes to the terminal, they wont let him board (he's 25 mins early not 30 after waiting).
@Delta That’s totally fine! I don’t care about the original seats, just wanted to make sure we have two seats to JFK without paying additional fees. If we have two seats, we’re good! I was able to check in! Thank you so much!!
@Delta The travel list is never complete!😊
@Delta Pyramids of Giza ❤️ but I doubt it would be this year.
@Delta Two more left...Jamaica &amp; Bahamas 😀
@Delta Are you paying for it then?
@Delta Grand Canyon on my mind.
@Delta Help me get there with a RT ticker for two to Bora Bora.
@Delta Can’t wait to get drafted to Iran 😍
@Delta Well, I wanted to go to Iran so probably not.
Woke up at 2am and drove 3.5 hours to the airport only to have my flight get delayed by 6 hours 😍 @Delta
All tea, everyone in the @Delta safety video looks crazy. It’s cute and sweet that they probably had actual employees do it but HIRE. ACTORS. FOR. THINGS. LIKE. THIS.
@Delta Thank you again! I sent one question back, and then I’m good to go.
@Delta I can DM my confirmation number for you to check
@Delta To be clear, I am not the traveler. I am simply calling out a fairly serious lapse that I observed that I believe should be addressed. Thank you for your prompt replies. I hope you will give just as prompt attention to improving performance at TRI.
@Delta Yo soy de España, no de Alemania
@Delta $29 to get a 7 year old in a lounge to get a water and use the rest room. How much water can a 7 year old use? Can't wait till Jan 30th when we get "free" companions in the lounge with our $100 increased $550 credit card....that was sarcasm.
@Delta Rebooking has been handled. A counter agent who causes delays by not knowing how to book an infant and a gate agent who releases a plane early while at least 8 passengers are in the terminal trying to get to the gate are deeper issues that are costing us time and YOU money.
@Delta stranded a couple and their 4-month old (along with a half-dozen others). The gate agent just let the half-empty plane depart 15 minutes early without checking for the missing passengers. VERY poor training at the gate and at the ticket counter!
Hi @Delta, I just recently became a member of your mileage program and when can I receive a card? Thanks!
@Delta I thought that MQMs beyond the medallion marker roll over. I go to my app and it says I have ZERO MQMs. What’s up!?!
@Delta hey delta, I’m trying to check in online for a trip home tomorrow and the first leg of my flight has dropped out of my queue. I can’t place a phone call because I’m abroad in Italy, can someone help me out via the web to confirm I can get back tomorrow?
@Delta Are prices to Mexico going to go down any time soon???? We’ve been going for Spring Break for 10 yrs and I’ve NEVER seen them this high, they’re out of control! For what it will cost my family of 5 we could take 10 to Paris!!
Fanboy level excited for the @Delta #CES2020 keynote on Tuesday...this frequent flier is stoked to be in the crowd to see what Delta has up its sleeve #AvGeek #DDMF
These older people on this @Delta flight are listening to a trump speech on full volume without headphones.
@Delta Thanks! They have asked for people on the 10am flight to come up front. Helps! And it seems like there are more agents now
@Delta Wonderful. Can you DM the details and information for this?
@Delta Please provide me a point of contact to submit my complaint to.
@Delta just asked me about my "snack experience" which is some new level of greymail hell.
@Delta I'm a service-member who took leave for the holidays to visit family with my 7 yo son; Christmas was all but ruined by Delta's failure to deliver my bags 6 days of an 8 day trip, including my son's medication. Bags weren't lost, just utterly neglected #Droppedtheball
@Delta did you take away “don’t upgrade my seat if I don’t keep my seat preference”?! I don’t want to lose my aisle seat for a crappy middle seat!!! Really upsetting
@Delta hey delta if I book two other folks on the same flight as me using my SkyMiles card will they also get a free checkin luggage for the first bag?
Sit on the runway for an hour to then find out there’s an “issue” with the plane. Finally deboard us then say it’s two bloody hours before the flight can leave. Good one @Delta WORST flying experience I’ve had to date.
@Delta I can’t believe I was sick and I had to pay $350 for a one way ticket home ($150 more than my round trip ticket.) #FlightUnfair #MakesNoSense
Whoever had the idea to start serving cheezits on @Delta flights: I love you. Thank you. I hope 2020 is good to you.
@Delta We checked in online . However all boarding tickets go to one cell phone. We have the fly delta app but it is telling us to check in which we already have done. How do we access our boarding passes through the app?
Dear Bismarck runway crew. If you are short staffed next weekend you will have some angry Bison fans CC: @Delta
Was just informed by a @Delta employee that economy seating is' "not suited for family travel." Might be useful for those traveling with children.
Great way to start my first @Delta flight of the year! Upgrade to First Class and the flight attendant says “I can’t remember what flight number this is, but we’re going to Detroit. That’s the important part. Don’t worry, I’m not flying the thing.” 😂 #keepinitreal #wheelsup
Of course the rest of my fam’s flight gets canceled for today.. Now they arrive on a day I work when I was originally supposed to be the one to pick them up. Thanks @Delta. 😤
Shoutout to @Delta for allowing me to waive the fee on my second checked in bag! First flight with y’all and y’all made my early morning so much easier 😊
Hey, @Delta. When I show up to a 6:25am flight at 6:20... uh, why can’t I get on the fucking plane? And why is your staff so happy to say no to me? You guys are absolute criminals. 15 minutes later sitting here I just saw the plane pulling away. Thanks for fucking nothing
Think I just saw a @Delta gate agent using ASL with a customer. How cool!
Hey @Delta it's my hubbys bday and we fly home tomorrow. Can you help me figure out how to use points to upgrade our seats??
@Delta Was scared I wouldn't make it back in time to go back to work yesterday due to snow &amp; icy conditions on the 1st but each flight had no delay, de-icing didn't take long, and I arrived at each destination on time. Starting 2020 off right! Great flying experience. Thank you!
@Delta has went dark on me just trying to get some assistance. The #socialmedia person at #Delta seems to only know how to say no even when trying to pay and not asking for anything free. #shocked
@Delta I TRAVEL LAST WEEK TO EUROPE AND I CAN NOT FIND THE WAY TO CHARGE MY MILES AT SKIMILES ...
@Delta baggage check lines at MSP are crazy long. I’m not going to miss my honeymoon flight right?
@Delta please assist a paying customer. For a later flight. #businessmanagement #CustomerExperience #CustomerSuccess
Never been so mad at @Delta what is service when you are offering to pay and they still will not assist?
@Delta As do I. It is unfortunate how rude the experience was for the young woman experiencing it.
Don’t buy basic fare from @Delta and expect any assistance for any reason. And I am a #amex gold delta member.
@Delta any chance for an upgrade to our wedding/honeymoon flights in May? 🙏#gettingmauied #2020wedding
@Delta Hi I bought one way ticket. Can I change round ticket ? ATL to HNL This week Sunday. Return 1/12
@Delta you have one CSR working any desk at AUS this morning with about 100 people in line. Fail.
@Delta yay thank u delta hero
@Delta hi frens what time does your shuttle start from terminal 4 to 2 at JFK?
@Delta you are in human!!! You changed my seat of choice with out asking. You have me wait in security lines 35 min like cattle, this service I pay for is bullshit!
@Delta Do you sell Fly &amp; Rail tickets to Delta customers flying to Frankfurt? I see American &amp; United listed as cooperating airlines so I find it hard to believe Delta wouldn’t participate too. Hoping it’s just an oversight &amp; Delta customers can purchase Fly and Rail tickets too.
@Delta #lateforwork MSY has no agents on duty!! I’ve been waiting for 30+mins!!! Trying to make a 5:40 flight!!!
@Delta Wow! My flight boards at 5 am. There 25 of us waiting
@Delta hi. We travel with your airline for the first time in July and I’m wanting to find out is my 9 year old daughter guaranteed a seat next to either myself or her dad or even her 17 year old sister when seats are allocated after check in? Thank you 😊
@Delta Do something about your flights from Singapore to US! Stop horrible Korean air codeshare and bring back Delta planes with ,2 3 2 or 2 4 2 configs!! N get Delta flights to resume out of SG pleeeaasseee!!!!!
@Delta it’s worst! My flight to Melbourne, Australia, doesn’t approve my bike into the airplane from Bogota, Colombia.
@Delta There must be 200+ in line now. Anything u can do to help?
@Delta The reserve card would grant access for complimentary upgrades without status?
@Delta #dislike why are we supp to arrive two hours before then??
@Delta upgraded my flight back home to first class.. don’t know why but thanks!
@Delta hi, I'm at EWR and there's no one to receive my luggage. My flight is at 5:10 am, what can I do?
@Delta wonder with what KLM comes this year, perhaps paying toilets in their club.
@Delta have you realized that the new KLM lounge in Amsterdam have been significantly reduced and now 1/2 of its guests have no place to seat. They turned the entire top floor to pay lounge.
@Delta what time does bag drop open at TPA?
@Delta What is the policy on bereavement travel for children who need to change a return flight to come back early for a funeral?
@Delta I DMed. Also sent pics of the plane
@Delta just booked a flight main cabin. Looking over my itinerary there is no option to pay for a first class seat with miles or money. It says all the seats are taken, however looking over the flight they are not taken. Why is this happening ?
Delta run me my money I’m not flying nowhere! @Delta
@Delta This happened everytime. I don't understand why this happens. 3rd time in a town when I check in bags.
@Delta Yes. Still trying to confirm where it is
@Delta Yes. And they can't find it. It was loaded in the plane as shown in my app
@Delta there is vomit 🤮 on my seat. My partner &amp; I we’re separated becuz of this. I’ll be in the air for the next 4.5 hours. I expect a response.
@Delta Once again, #Delta airlines has misplaced my luggage. Happens everytime I check in a bag with them 😤
@Delta 's customer support was phenomenal. Got a spelling correction handled in about 4 mins total
@Delta I need help ASAP 😭😭😭
Thanks @Delta for still having a Family Emergency Travel program. You're the only ones who are willing to give a little relief to your customers booking last minute when they need to see a hospitalized loved one.
@Delta Just how does it work
@Delta Tried a different browser. It worked once but then did just the same, giving the error message.
@Delta When will I see my rollover Medallion MQM’s updated on your app?
@Delta Really? It's fully up? I'm getting a system error message. Started about 15 minutes ago. Was working but now when I hit search I get Oh no! We're sorry, but there was a problem processing your request. Please go back and try again. If the problem persists, please call Delta...
@Delta do I just have really bad luck and the website only sucks when I try to use it or does it just struggle a lot for everybody? You'd sell more tickets if it would actually bring up flights.
@Delta You're suggesting that you took our original seats away so we could be standby for a possible upgrade?
@Delta Thanks. Too bad you’re stopping your service in Haiti💔
Hey @Delta! I was a total idiot and left my wallet in my seat pocket tonight (landed at NYC LaGuardia). What is the best course of action to get it back?
Super disappointed that @Delta of all airlines doesn’t have policies to protect their disabled passengers especially when flying is the easiest method of transportation for them. That phone call with their representative yesterday was ridiculous smh
.@Delta cut me from a flight I had already paid for without notification. 1 hour and $120 later I’m back on the same flight I booked and paid for in October for $332.60 on 10/30/19. Happy New Year!
Had a great flight back on @Delta flight 2002 from sfo to sea this evening. Our flight attendant was very attentive in first class and deserves recognition for his quality work. He never took the smile off his face and made the flight very enjoyable.
@Delta 🗣Hello there! I flew today aboard DL685, and I want to testify that Ms Laura is the most professional and the nicest flight attendant I have ever met since almost 40 years I’ve been traveling. Wow! 🙌🏽👍🏽👏🏽 There really is something about the way she serves!🏆 ✅🥇🤎
@Delta So your multiple errors led to us having a horrible experience. You sold us seats that wouldn't work. You upgraded us to seats that wouldn't work. And you put us on standby
@Delta Made by delta? We received the c upgrade notification at 240
@Delta This is massively unacceptable. There was no schedule change. You sent an upgrade notification this afternoon knowing we had an infant in arms
Hi @Delta we are flying tomorrow from Orlando to Atlanta and we as family are total separated through the plane, so our son of 2 and daughter of 7 have to sit alone? How can we change this without calling, we have no US sim?
@Delta Ecstatic to see you in court soon.
@Delta In addition to that, Brazilian Aviation law states that if a flight is delayed more than 4 hrs, travelers are lawfully entitled to book on another airline. Yet Delta has blocked us from doing that. You aren’t booking us on any other flights, this is quite unlawful!
@Delta Any chance you can put him in the exit row and have the person next to him throw him out of the exit mid flight?
@Delta Hey Delta, I’ve been stuck at GRU for five hours because your partner,GOL, caused us to miss our connection to JFK. We’re stranded because you guys have blocked the database, not allowing us to book any other flights.
@Delta DL 2781, January 2nd, lax to Detroit, Wilcox/Gainey
Hi @Delta, you upgraded my wife and I. Now, our original seats are gone and we have seats at the back of the plane for our cross country flight! Totally acceptable
@Delta It was flight number DL1625 from Atlanta to Baltimore.
@Delta disappointed is an understatement. Experienced multiple delays, delayed baggage, and no pilot or crew for our last flight which led to missing a day of work. All you offered was a $75 gift card when I paid over $700 for this ticket. What happened to customer service??
I hope we can all learn from this @Delta Captain and remember to look out for each other a little more and take care of each other.
But I won’t forget your face. Im flying ~175k miles on @Delta a year, so there’s a good chance I’ll run into you again greeting me at the door and I will always say thank you Thank you so much for caring enough to take the initiative to contact me and return the case. 8/
This effort was the Captain of my @Delta flight from LAX to MSY. I know it’s not standard practice, but when we were taking in the hotel lobby, you could tell that he truly understood what his passengers and customers go through 6/
I love good hearted nice people. Here’s a great @Delta customer service story for all- I flew into MSY today for this weekends game. I was on a conference call using an AirPod as I walked off the aircraft, nothing unusual 1/
Incredibly disappointed that a lengthy call with @Delta regarding a billing error ended with the supervisor hanging up on me without any attempt to resolve the situation.
@Delta It doesn’t, because American and other airlines allow more than 1 checked bag. Thanks for the response tho.
@Delta Guessing That’s on Top of the checking a bag fee (my ticket doesn’t include one). Thanks!
The DFS community can often seem mean spirited, but it’s inspiring to see us put our differences aside and rise up for things that really matter. Fix this now @Delta!
delayed an hour for my flight (i have a connection from Detroit to Newark) and the @Delta attendant is giving the most detailed explanation and apology i’ve ever heard w reassurance of rebooking. usually airlines give ya a “sorry, good luck!”
@Delta Originally on DL5514 ATL to SHV. Paid for two First class Tix to attend father in law's funeral on the 3rd. Flight cancelled. Put on a Monroe, LA flight, told to get off. Currently sitting on DL5294, not in first class, nor sitting with my wife. Most unhappy.
My entire @Delta plane ride home, the woman next to me was watching a tv show on her iPad with NO HEADPHONES. And the flight attendants did nothing. It was the most annoying trip I’ve ever experienced.
@Delta just spent an hour being told no one knows why the seats we purchased 6 months ago we're changed and even though they're upgraded seats available we can't book them....#terribleservice #DeltaAirlines #help
@Delta I am still waiting for a resolution to the issue I raised. I understand that you have passed on the information to your leadership team. However, how will you make this right?
Shout out to the @Delta pilot on flight DL2370 who took the time to help a scared little guy off the plane while his parents had their hands full, literally. #SmallActsOfKindness
@Delta Hey, my bag got damaged and I got a link for replacement. What do I do if I don’t want any of them (the bag is a very specialty bag - loooong nd thin carrying light tubes)... I have a claim number
@Delta I am in the private message area
@Delta Thanks. Is this all done airside, or will it require waiting at main checkin for baggage recheck and clearing tsa security?
@Delta Why the hell would anyone in first class try to do you a solid (you oversold the plane), if you are gonna give up their seat before you need it... And then there is the being lied to part
Hey @Delta, I would like a refund for my flight because #TheDevilWearsPrada Is no longer part of your movie selections. Absolutely unacceptable.
@Delta Do I use the at Delta in the DM
@Delta Lol the agent specifically told me they would not touch the seat until they knew if they needed it.... basically was lied too and pissed away 30k in miles for trying to do you guys a favor Good to see that’s how you treat your most valuable customers
Lol @Delta, I volunteer to be bumped when you need 8 seats, end up not needing me after some no shows which is fine, but then the flight attendant tells me I can’t have my assigned first class aisle seat that I paid for! What the hell is!?!?! Told me I wouldn’t lose my seat!
@Delta This really needs to be better documented because I spent 20 minutes trying to find it. Where are the benefits I feel totally ripped off
@Delta I have a flight coming up on January 25th and I have claustrophobia. I was wondering if i could possibly get a seat closer to the front of the plane . I am traveling with my husband.
@Delta do you still have to pick your medallion Parks online? I tried to find that area a couple days ago on the website but I couldn’t find it and I lost my status as of January 1. Anyway to still claim them
@Delta it’s ironic how as a delta medallion member I get recognized on partner flights way more often than on delta’s own flight.
@Delta Where can I check limits and fees?
@Delta quick question, HND-LAX-JFK, do I clear immigration&amp;customs in LAX and have to collect and recheck baggage during the layover?
@Delta I’m team southwest from here on out
@Delta Good thx it says HUQV9G my name is Kimberly Patz.
@Delta hi guys, in traveling nyc - Mexico City (1stop in hou) in Saturday with a bag that might exceed the 23kgs....what do I do?
@Delta thank you for the upgrade ❤️ way to start the new year 🎉
@Delta But you just stayed non stop through Aug 2020
@Delta Well if you check the flight path you will see we went from let’s say 8000ft to 10,000 ft in about five seconds. Enough that my neighbor vomited on me.
Aye I’m fw @Delta man!! Knees got hella room, they got a phone charger, planes clean, I ain’t rubbing elbows with the next mf... You got my business from now on! ✊🏾💯
@Delta I can’t seem to find that flight offered on your app
@Delta would you please advise what happened that cause our flight to severely pull up during our descent? Flight 2819 into SLC on 1/2/2020? Thx!
@Delta The check-in desk couldn't explain why the previously confirmed seats were changed. They advised to talk to a gate agent which we did but they weren't willing or able to correct the mistake and continued the process of boarding the minors separate from their accompanying adult.
@Delta Check In for Flight 2046 for January 3rd from PHX to ATL is disabled rn even it’s less than 24 hours till the flight and check in emails have been sent out. Could you please investigate this issue?
@Delta what’s up with the 1 checked bag into EYW? You’re the only airline working this angle at that airport. C’mon man!
@Delta are you flying non stop from IND to CUN this summer? I usually fly Saturday and Saturday and you’ve always offered nonstop.
@Delta For anyone else whoever reads this, Delta did nothing in the DMs. They just didn’t want to write out their unhelpfulness in a public tweet.
@Delta hi, can you tell me why DL4365 on 27th November was cancelled please?
@Delta I would like a call back to have someone assist us with changing our flight, since we were moved to a significantly earlier flight and are traveling with an infant that we booked a seat for.
@Delta your callback service is horrific. I had been quoted for a call back for 15 min and have been waiting well over an hour.
Nothing like missing your connecting @Delta flight because of delays in Atlanta 🤦🏽‍♂️
I was weary.. but they were kind. Not the evil I expected but refund processed, kindness given (well sorta). But one still stood in front of me.. my return was through the Jedi @Delta a refund assured they are the chosen ones! Always kind always great service no issues I'm sure!
I been on hold for 50 minutes. @Delta this is sort of absurd ...
@Delta exceptional in flight service experience from CDG to LAX today!
@Delta So whose responsible if someone gets hurt?
@Delta I just sent you a DM about using my regional upgrade coupon!
@Delta *team...PS love the new first class!
@Delta I hope he does well with a full recovery. Would love for the crew to know my gratitude!! Definitely tram work!!!
@Delta The poll that's part of the original Tweet.
@Delta Me too! But more importantly, what's your answer?
@Delta Oh, guess what, ATL sent the wrong part. Joy. Now a 12:30am depart IF that part even arrives and works.
Landed early on my @Delta flight but sitting on the plane because our gate isn't available. So would you rather...
@Delta you suck. flight was scheduled for 3pm from fort meyers. switched us to a broken plane. had to fly the part in from atlanta and they brought the WRONG part. wow! #frequentflyer #delta #traveldisaster
Hey @Delta I was on flight 1949 SNA to SLT this morning. The flight was delayed 3 hours. It ruined my plans to ski today and enjoy my first day of vacation. I won’t be flying #delta again!! #problems #delta #deltaairlines #flight #airlineproblems
@Delta I understand it's not your personal fault just extremely frustrating that you can't get a set plane at a set gate
@Delta That's the best you can do?
@Delta are Basic Economy tickets eligible for 24-Hour Risk-Free cancellation?
In the year of our vocal legend Mariah Carey 2020, if I can order a cup of coffee and watch it make its way to my front door, @Delta and other airlines should have the technology to properly track people’s luggage when it’s in their care
Hey @Delta, when the unfortunate time comes how does one get on a farewell flight for the MD88? The MD88/90/717 is by far my most favorite aircraft to fly on domestically and to this day the only aircraft I’ve snoozed in on multiple occasions #longlivetheMadDog
@Delta hey sis, thanks to your incompetent employees my mom had to start off her new year without her luggage for the only vacation she’s been able to take in a year. Let’s chat about it.
@Delta created a Twitter just for this, get a plane for dl flight 5888 from JFK to JAX and stop delaying and changing gates. This is absurd so done with your airline.
@Delta Hello! My confirmation number was gf8gby. We were waiting to close the door and a full verbal argument in which the gate agents and flight attendants were screaming at eachother. That resulted in delayed boarding and no ground service for first class.
@Delta Oh, I see now you’ve disappeared Delta. Shocking.
Hey @Delta, can you start using non-plastic cups for flights? Better 4 environment.
@Delta I want a refund of the “excess baggage fee” that I was charged for having to check my carry on. It wasn’t excess baggage; it just had to go in cargo instead of my overhead bin. The plane didn’t carry any extra weight so why did I have to pay extra? Extortionists!
@Delta has horrible customer service. Just trying to make a simple itinerary change and am willing to pay for it. Can’t do it online and the phone number just busy for hours (not even an option to wait on hold).
Everyone on this @Delta flight from London to NYC is a goddamn trash fire.
@Delta I will !! ⭐️ 🏆 thanks so much
No kudos for @Delta - why not reduce flight prices to Australia, given the current disaster? Would like to plan a trip in a few months to infuse tourist $$ into economy. #AUSTRALIANBUSHFIRES
@Delta so, I got an email to check in for a flight to Santa Domingo. It’s supposedly for tomorrow. It shows me going there then flying to Zurich on January 28th. I booked no such flight.
@Delta DL4842 working around 6pm; tall bald gentleman with a mustache.
@Delta Was informed that repairs will only be “considered” for reimbursement. What would disqualify my broken luggage for reimbursement?
@Delta We made it!! Thank you!!
@Delta flight credits from Costco. $500 for $449!
On @Delta 8353 from IST to CDG with my Amex Gold Skymiles card &amp; still have to pay 60 euro to check bags. Why? Benefits clearly state FREE checked bags.
@Delta My dog and I love flying with you.
@Delta Flight 1270-anything but boring. Got to travel in a new plane with awesome pods in first class. But we had a passenger with massive stroke that needed medical attention. Proud I was able to help him out!! Flight crew was great getting us all that was needed quickly!
Upgraded on my first flight of 2020! Thanks @Delta!
@Delta please don’t let flight 1094 leave without us in ATL! We r coming in from BHM 1321 now!!
@Delta where is Delta customer service in JFK terminal four before security
Hey @Delta - I spent $92K last year on my Delta AmEX. Why am I not Platinum status?
@Delta Okay I understand what’s in the documentation now but I do not understand why we wouldn’t be able to rollover the excess MQS?
@Delta I was so close to gold status for 2020 and now I’m not seeing any of those flights carried over to this year for my renewed 2021 status, everything is back at 0, what gives?
We'll be lucky if we get out of here in the next 30 because now it looks like they're NOT loading bags and they're putting things back on to the luggage hauler. I haven't gotten the notification from @Delta that my bag was loaded yet.
@Delta select which legs we want upgrades for if the system just ignores that and defaults to global profile preferences? Your Gold Medallion customer service however was quick and able to get us back together in our original seats. I’m grateful for that.
@Delta Thanks for the response! I see no reference to whether MQS rollover only just a reference to the MQS on the linked page.
@Delta Yes, apparently your system uses your customers’ preferences in their profile for upgrade decisions rather than the selections they make for individual reservations. That’s a major problem with your system that needs to be corrected. What the point of letting us (1/2)
@Delta 2 questions for you: first, where can I find economy fare class descriptions? Second, I'm waiting on my new Delta Amex but want to book my flights now, do you hold reservations (I'm Gold Medallion) so I can pay with it?
Thank you @Delta for giving us the vacation from hell! We love that you continue to split up our family on our return flight!!!! Especially when we booked our flights in June and specifically picked seats next to each other!
Opting out of facial recognition means I might have issues coming back into my country? Why is this @Delta? There's so many issues with facial recognition yet you still want to force it upon people?
Flight wasn’t even full yet @Delta still charged $500... why!! It’s a one way... domestic.. I flew to Barcelona 2 years ago round trip for $520... 😡😡😡
Dear @Delta; you need to have a way to submit kudos for exceptional people on your app imho; I just heard one of the funniest gate agents in all my years of flying at gate B17; CVG
Thank you @Delta for the awesome receptionist at the San Antonio airport! But no thank you for overcharging $500 for a one way flight from San Antonio to Phoenix.. 😡 #Ridiculous
@Delta is there seriously no phone number for the Delta sky club? I have been on chat with customer service for the last 30 minutes and the conclusion is I have to buy a plane ticket to resolve an issue? This can't be right.
@Delta Do you offer Helping special needs adult to gate
@Delta regained my Gold status and upgraded 3x already to 1st Class...thank you Delta!
@Delta thought passengers were unruly... flight attendants and podium staff are screaming at eachother. All first class can hear. Flight 1898. From msy to msp....very unprofessional.
Not happy with @Delta as I’m sending 2 minors on a long intercontinental flight today, together with an adult guardian, made sure to reserve seats next to each other, only to find out that #Delta has changed seats and now separated my kids from their accompanying adult! #crazy
@Delta shout out to gate agent Kelly at B4 at GSP. So kind and helpful to my elderly mom! #grateful
@Delta when will rollover MQMs show up?
@Delta If I fly I need special assistance with going to the airport to my Gate airplane I have special needs
@Delta why do MQM but not MQS rollover towards medallion status?? I had extra MQS that I now apparently lost... ☹️ #frustrated
@Delta now the pilot told us that the pushback crew got called away, and he doesn’t know when we’ll be departing. I will be contacting customer service in the morning.
@Delta is the worst airline ever and I’m never traveling with them again👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
@Delta DM has been sent. Please follow up as soon as you can. Thanks for your assistance.
@Delta What should we do? How can we take it ?
@Delta can someone assist me with some missing luggage
@Delta The passive aggression continues!!! Very on brand!! Nice job!!!
@Delta Hello. I am supposed to be on a Delta flight that departs in 20 mins yet, Delta refuses to check me in. I have been at the airport for almost 2 hours and Delta has NOT been helpful. Please assist!!
@Delta hi I have a question, can you PM me please
Very disappointed in @Delta I was issued a credit for my flight due to medical reason and when I was going to redeem it they said it was a mistake. Please do your job better.
First @Delta flight of 2020 is standby and first class, and life couldn’t be better. #DTWbound
@Delta Thanks. But what about Europe? Is it the same?
@Delta sufrí un retraso de 5 horas, dónde debo reclamar?
Kudos to the @Delta social media team for handling our rebooking to Denver swiftly and accurately over DM while I was in flight.
@Delta Huge kudos to your customer service professional (emphasis on the word PROFESSIONAL), Nic, who not only listened to my concerns but responded w/ compassion, courtesy &amp; kindness. What started out as a humiliating experience was addressed w/ respect &amp; positively resolved.
@Delta really disappointed in your customer service. I booked a flight and less than 24 hours later the price went down and your cs rep did not offer to rebook for me. Now I am stuck with a large credit.
@Delta Is it possible to use miles to pay for a flight that includes a companion ticket certificate?
@Delta please help!!! Stuck in Kelowna, BC and can’t make my SEA to LAX flight. Trying to call but can’t get through.
@Delta why can’t the boarding time be updated on the app? I arrive at 3 on to be told :30 more minutes. Could have kept charging and working in sky club.
@Delta trying to get luggage for my son for his semester abroad. If his bag is over 62 linear inches, what are the charges?
@Delta I just got my bag in Austin airport and not only is it soaking wet but there is standing water in my bag and the zipper is broken. I can promise you I didn't give you a bag full of water. Oh and it's not even raining in Austin so not sure if you threw my bag in a pool.
@Delta I made several flight changes and still does the same thing. This might just means Delta website sucks 😂
@Delta, you upgraded me and my husband on DL82 despite the fact that I specifically requested NOT to be upgraded because all of the upgrade seats were separated. Now I’m in row 16 and he’s in row 17 on opposite sides of the plane. Nicely done! #GoldMedallion: off to a good start.
Honestly @Delta who keeps receipts from March 2019?? Most people don't! I'm not a receipt hoarder! But I see what ya'll tryna do..I'm still going to file my claim with or without the original receipt.. I still have my TJMaxx purchase in my banking records. It's unfair for you
@Delta Maybe you should match them to travelers before sending alerts in an app.
@Delta I’ve flown through Boston several times. There is 0% chance that I make that connection.
@Delta right I assumed that so i changed the flight and still nothing.
@Delta Thanks for not upgrading me on ATL-AMS (DL9667) today. Instead, I’m in a wonderful isle seat where I slammed into every two minutes. #DiamondMedallion and 3 months away from family every year is overrated.
Looks like @Delta doesn’t want me to keep Platinum status for next year. I haven’t flown another airline in 2 years, but just had to book my second non-Delta business trip of the year, and it’s only January 2nd. Fares are skyrocketing compared to competitors.
@Delta I would like to just reiterate in my previous tweet that this is pretty ridiculous. I hope Delta will consider changing this in the future considering Delta's motto is that they will take you anywhere.
@Delta when will rollover MQM's show up in my skymiles account?
Best part? @Delta when the service person called to make the change, even the customer rep asked why we were being charged and the desk rep said “because our supervisor said it’s a $50 charge fee” epic customer service at its best.
@Delta I have to book through a website so I need that option to show on Delta website. Can you confirm if this exists there?
.@Delta my wife’s boarding pass was under her married name, her passport says her maiden name. $2800 for some flights and gouging a $50 “name change fee”? That’s amazing.
Thanks for damaging my suitcase @Delta 🙄.
My @Delta flight is taking off 45 minutes later than we should’ve arrived in salt lake!!!!!!! I love how delta is the only airline to fly out of salt lake!
@Delta thanks it’s really confusing because i had to buy the seat when checking in, so expedia wouldn’t know. but since the reservation was canceled i figured Delta would consider it then unused.
What a horrible company @Delta is. Separating families while traveling in their planes. I can’t seat with my 3 and 5 years old. They charge in order to do that. Shame on you!
@Delta I’m only just learning! It was a Christmas present and I figured an 8hr flight is a great time to learn 😂 I’ve DM’d 🙂
@Delta My time is flexible. I would be returning to Atlanta on 1/23. What is the lowest cost flight?
@Delta, I cannot believe that you would let me lose Gold Status over $68. SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS and in order to “elevate” MY status, I would’ve had to pay $500. Outrageous! You should do more for your loyal customers! #DELTA #SKYMILES #DOMORE #LOYALTY
@Delta I am traveling on 1/20. I searched the Delta App and nothing shows up.
@Delta I was told over the phone that Delta financial team has chosen to not offer a one stop flight through Atlanta from Ft Myers to Daytona Beach despite having flights connecting these cities. Very ridiculous. I have to book 2 one way tickets now??? Or drive 4 hours???
Hey @Delta so should I have to wait 58 minutes to talk to a human or 24 hours to get an email response if I simply need a receipt (not listed on account through standard process). I continue to be amazed at the “quality” carrier having such poor customer processes.
Scarred for life. Saw a roach crawl out the vent on my flight @Delta 🤮
@Delta I ain't a snitch 🖕🏿😑🖕🏿
Starting off 2020 and I'm half way to the million mile mark with @Delta. A ways to go! #SkyMilesLife
That feeling when @Delta upgrades your seat to First on the first business trip of the year. 😁✈️
@Delta I just spent 34 minutes on hold attempting to add a Known traveller TSA number to an existing flight. Had to hang up. Couldn’t wait any longer. Is that not beyond ridiculous??
Yoo @Delta what a scam. I’m short $42 of keeping my silver status but in order for me to keep my silver status y’all want to charge me $599 to keep my status? Lmfao what a scam. Is their an airline that doesn’t scam ppl??
@Delta I have spent thousands of $ on Delta and I plan on cancelling my AmEx and finding alternate airlines for all of my travel. I love Delta but am so disappointed in you guys. This would've been such an easy concession to make and I feel alienated as a customer. (3/3)
@Delta I spoke to customer service and was referred to email, where the rep was totally unwilling to extend my eligibility period to make Gold for 2020. I am incredibly frustrated by your lack of flexibility. (2/3)
@Delta I've been a dedicated Delta customer for years, recruiting my friends and colleagues to your business. I'm an AmEx holder, and always fly Delta over cheaper options. This year I was 2k MQM short of reaching Gold for 2020 due to a work trip change. (1/3)
As a small business owner, this isn't about extra snacks or a possible upgrade to First. And @Delta should be aware how crucial it is reps have fully accurate info, especially when customers are dealing with a stressful major life event.
@Delta No. No error. When I click on complete purchase it loops me back to flight selection again.
2 years ago @Delta denied my status match request, for reasons that they couldn't fully explain to me. In those 2 years, I've flown almost 140,000 miles on other airlines. Maybe you are ready to reconsider, Delta?
@Delta All good. This is a champagne problem.
I spoke to multiple folks @Delta about how I can keep Silver medallion, which I was just shy of beacuse of canceling Dec plans due to my dad's cancer. 2 of those reps (while genuinely trying to help) gave me info that was actively wrong.
@Delta Thanks - no issues, but want to make sure they are credited before Feb so that status is maintained.
@Delta hey, when do you credit MQMs for Amex threshold passed? Don’t see it registered yet...for last year...
@Delta you need to change the seating on the planes; they have become impossible to get into and out of, and I believe they pose a threat to our safety. #757’ssuck
@Delta your web checkin doesn't say ANYTHING about such "season policy"
@Delta has the kindest employees, thoroughly impressed with how well they took care of us on all our flights. 🥰
@Delta she heard the whole conversation. 4) I had to buy an overpriced cheap quality bag to split my bag contents on the fly. 5) As a courtesy the minimum that I would expect is for you to not charge me the extra bag or refund me that I payed with the Delta card since again,
@Delta "are not allowed from Nov 16 to Jan 16".That said: 1) its outrageous that you apply policies without previous notice during the web checkin. 2) Your bag fees are outrageous and your service deficient. 3) Your agents dont care about your customers, not even the manager,
@Delta I told him that I'm aware of that and that I would like to pay the (outrageous) $100 extra for the overweight. He still deny my request because there was a policy that NEVER showed up while doing my online checkin at the webpage that overweight bags
@Delta While making my check in process for my flight today I specified that I was checking in a bag online. When arriving at the check in counter in MEX the agent (Alan) told me that he couldn't process my bag checkin because it was overweight.
@Delta Me and my wife and three kids flew out of Kennedy airport because you over sold tickets. I get to to Brasil (São Paolo) our connecting flight had left. So your best solution was to wait to the next day. With 3 kids that wasn’t happening after a 9 hour flight.
@Delta Thank you so much for the quick reply. I will forward the info.
Given how expensive air travel is, you'd think they would have designed a system by now that does not circulate lavatory smells throughout the aircraft. [Tweet sent thanks to my $35 internet purchase which is absolutely insane and should be illegal.] cc @Delta
@Delta As a medallion gold member, I was appalled to hear from my cousin over the holidays that his suitcase was destroyed on his recent Delta flight, and when he asked an agent about it, they refused to do anything. Please help. This is not the Delta I know.
@Delta Please let me know how you can make me feel like being a platinum member is worth it. I would hate to have to switch to a different airline
@Delta I need an agent. I have a complain to make. I don't need a bot or an offline conversation. Just in the last 3 months I have spent over 2k in flight tickets and its unacceptable that not even as a GoldCard can't get an agent on the phone. And you insist me to upgrade my card??
@Delta why can’t I fly to FLL from MSP on a different plane? All of the planes flying this route are now 757’s, the most customer unfriendly planes there are. The Delta Comfort seats are not comfortable; if there is extra leg room, I’ve never experienced it.
@Delta They are here at the desk &amp;checking people in a little after12 but they’re here!Thank you but this truly is my last time I shouldn’t have anxiety about dealing with staff or worrying if my things will be handled correctly or make it to my destination with me!Ty for addressing it.
Thanks @Delta for the airplane trading card and pilot wings pin. My kid has been showing them off all week!
Mil gracias @Delta por la atención inmediata y darme solución a mi problema.... 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼✨✨✨
@Delta Disappointed to have flown with you, went on a flight from LAX to SHANGHAI only to be returned due to non visa. do you guys not check proper documentation before? no employee from Delta took the time to explain to us the documents needed, spent over $10,000 for nothing.
Headed to DC for #AALS and scored an upgrade on my @Delta flight. Happy birthday to me!!!! 🎂 🎁 🎉✈️
@Delta Was also just told I couldn’t board with sky priority as a platinum member.
“Upgraded” on @Delta during boarding (boarding pass still shoes upgraded seat) but suddenly they don’t want to honor the upgrade. They just go ahead and upgrade somebody else, and that’s it. 🤷🏻‍♂️ This may be their introduction to how “Medallion” status works in practice (?).
@Delta Thanks - can you tell me what days these flights operate to/from SLC? It's not clear at all.
Over 1 hr for a callback @Delta ? Really?
@Delta Disappointed that you let empty premium select and delta one seats go unused when medallion members who spent 10s of thousands are stuck sitting in coach.. where is the love on international upgrades
How long does it take for my 2019 roll over MQMs to show up on my @Delta account?
@Delta Not yet, think they maybe waiting until 1230, it’s fine I don’t want any situation with them and need my bags to make the plane.
@Delta can you please DM me about a reservation for tomorrow I need to change? I can't wait two hours on the phone to find out if my ticket is changeable. I'm at the ER with a sick kid. Thanks!
@Delta I can send you that. But honestly the time I spent for tracking and mental stress is really pissing me off.
@Delta Hi, Could you please inform me the alcohol restrictions on checked baggage if I buy it before security checks?
Just took a 2 hour nap in ATL @Delta Sky Club and I feel MAGNIFICENT! 2020 is great ✨
@Delta did you discontinue CMH to SLC direct service? I am trying to book but it's not coming up as an option any longer. Thanks.
@Delta wants me to pay 125 fucking dollars to bring a CAT in the cabin with me. the airline notorious for killing pets that go in the cargo hold. cool stuff. not at all similar to extortion.
@Delta I just need my delayed baggage 🤯. Why should I follow up with you everyday, getting the same answer that you don’t have any status.
@Delta I did. I was told I was going to receive a call back in 2 hours -_-
Anyone else having trouble with @Delta website? It keeps throwing an error saying "last name cannot be left blank" when trying to pay, even though all the info is there! What a waste of time-wonder who unleashes untested websites like this!
Hey @Delta you guys (&amp; affiliates) will forever have the BEST meals ever. Breakfast was yumsters as usual 🥰
@Delta what's going on with my flight (1040). It's showing on time, but the flight that makes it up has been taxiing in Nassau for the last hour? #confusedinfll
Someone shit in the aisle mid flight. @Delta worst flight ever 🤢 Didn’t even do anything about it, ended up having to step over it when exiting
Purchased insured @Delta flight that I couldn't make due to a family emergency. Insurance company won't approve payback (what are they there for?) and Delta won't credit or help in any way for lost funds. Hours of support calls with bad customer service must improve in 2020.
@Delta Alessandro at lax terminal 2 gates needs some serious re training, extremely rude to everyone including an elderly woman boarding with a child
What's up with @Delta? Trying to book tickets and it loops me back to ticket selection when pay. Any idea?
@Delta Gotta give a shoutout to the Montreal gate agents working Delta 5525 today. These guys were the friendliest, happiest agents I’ve ever had! He even popped his head into the cabin before closing the door to wish us all a Happy New Year!Thank u Delta #deltaloyal
@Delta Ok, thanks again for your help!
@Delta kiss my ass. You just told me to my face that my dog doesn’t count as Carry on and then make me check in my luggage at the gate? Yeah never again.
A few days late but still thinking about it! @Delta flight 1562 on Dec 30th, Joseph set the standard for amazing customer service. He’s why I keep flying Delta, thanks for a great 2019
@Delta Very, disappointed in my Delta flights over Christmas. While I get it, it's not the attendant's duty to "clean" the plane, and I definitely know it's not mine, but I don't expect to open the tray to find it caked w/sticky crap; and no one has anything to clean it. GROSS!
Finally back home but basically thought I was gonna die when my @Delta pilot last night warned us about turbulence and then 10 mins later said, “it only gets worse from here” and just left us looking at each other. Like damn, should I have brought a helmet?
@Delta Awesome. Is it available on the return on 23rd? Or just the 22nd? Thanks again.
@Delta is there free checked baggage allowance if I fly basic economy from Dublin to jfk?
Hi @Delta. I’m looking for some assistance bringing an animal in hold on an upcoming flight, but I’m in India and my phone won’t let me call you. Can you help?
@Delta I missed Delta Silver Medallion status by 408 miles can you believe that?!? Unfortunately theres no way to just buy 500 mqm's like there is 1000 or more
@Delta however my boarding passes do not say I have TSA precheck
@Delta hi my travel agent entered my nexus card when she booked my ticket.. when checking in i cannot enter in
@Delta how long does it take for my rollover MQMs to appear in my account?
@Delta I am locked Out of the app and in Mexico. What is the local number to call to get access to app online
@Delta I’m stuck in MEXICO with my infant son because apparently there was a flight change and now I’m not able to check in. How is this possible ? #pleasehelp.
@Delta when status resets when do rollover miles from last year show on the app ?
Not sure how my flight was booked on @Delta when my connection for my Atlanta-&gt; Seattle flight boards at 5:05 and I land in Atlanta at 5:08... so are y’all going to pay for my missed flight or?
@Delta Shouldnt we do this on DM???
@Delta My daughter has to have this laptop! I cannot afford another one!
@Delta If your flight attendants or whoever cleans the plane, simply put the seat number on it and the flight number, how hard can it be? Maybe you need a better process?
@Delta Same flight day before or after on outbound?
@Delta Can you refund some of the price of this flight for me please? We aren’t getting the Delta product I am used to.
@Delta Honestly, I don’t need anything. I was publicly thanking you for getting us home safely, and for your entire crew inside and outside the plane being absolutely top-notch. It was flight 2630, if you want to pass along my gratitude for their great attitude &amp; getting us home safely.
@Delta it has been 21 days. My daughter left her Dell laptop in her seat pocket. We were in first class. You know who was sitting there. She filed a claim. How can it be this hard to return it? She needs it for college! Please do something! #DeltaAirlines #LostAndFound
Yoo @Delta where are my bags? I thought y’all said it would make it to the carousel in 20mins guarantee...
@Delta is there global upgrade availability on DL 9375 on 2/14 And DL 9348 on 2/22. If not anything around those dates? Similar fare.
@Delta my wife has repeated issue with her skymiles account. Please msg me.
@Delta the power / TVs did not work on my side of the airplane yesterday on my flight to LGA and flight attendants could not fix the issue. What gives?
@Delta Really appreciate the help, agent was super helpful!
@Delta do all flight that go to Mexico direct go out international terminal ?
@Delta could you clarify: I thought any extra MQMs and MQDs earned in the past year that didn’t hit a qualifying status rolled over to the next year? I’m Silver Medallion
@Delta finally unpacking and discovered rips in the front of my luggage and the zipper completely gone. Tried to fill out a form but was told I didn’t give them notice that day. Please help?
@Delta Can't book a flight online, when I get to checkout it just keeps kicking me back out to search results....help?
@Delta Is there a way to refund the second half of a round-trip ticket? I am going to be taking a different flight home for an upcoming trip that I booked with points on my own.
I need help with one of my 8 upcoming flights with you @Delta can you help me?
@Delta a big thank you to May on Medallion reservation for her patience and help. She went out of her way to assist me with a difficult reservation change. Much appreciated!
@Delta my known traveler number was not on my boarding pass so updated my profile then I called in.was told they deleted my checkin and to re check in again. Tried that and still no TSA pre check on boarding pass. Can you help? Do you want my delta #?
Shoutout to the gate agent currently at C21 in MSP, who has been doing a fabulous job communicating with passengers about this weirdly-delayed flight to BDL @Delta
@Delta has apparently made changes to their website and ticket pricing for the new year and man o man are these rates stacked to stick it to flyers. I am gobsmacked at the hutzpah. Multicity ORF to IAH to CDG to ORF is over $6K. If priced seperately the legs don't even hit $3K.
@Delta I have had my flight delayed 3 times already today any way I can find out why
@Delta Shame on you Delta, for what you did to Ms. Llanos, a flight attendant's flight attendant, 57 years she worked for you, firing her over a milk carton??!! 😠
Dear @Delta , the year is 2020. Stop charging $200 to change a flight when I’m still using your airline. Do better. Sincerely, Chris
@Delta I need some help. We're in Christchurch airport and can't get on flight because of glitch with my daughter's ticket
@Delta will give it a try, thank you! appreciate the t&amp;c, i am usually not without a place to hang out when i'm passing through here so was underprepared this time around! thanks again :)
@Delta Thank you! So does my travel that takes place in January 2020 count towards the reclaiming for the year in those first 3 months? or do the 3 months start on Feb 1st?
Hey @Delta, your website specifically says that extra miles earned after a medallion qualification carry over to kick start the earning for next year and yet mine have reset to 0??
@Delta i'm trying to find the site where i submit my request for "platinum exception/extension status based upon unforeseen circumstances in 2019. i spoke with the Platinum Medallion desk and they told me to start the process by submitting a request but cannot find a link
hi @Delta! happy new year! i am on a 12-hour layover in boston and was hoping to access the sky club to freshen up before my next flight, but i left my physical gold amex this trip 🙈 any chance i can still get in?
@Delta purchased some local wine, does it need to go in my checked bag (3) bottles, it’s not from duty free store....???
@Delta I can’t find where to complain on the app. But I’m on an 8 hour flight which I was planning on working during &amp; bought WiFi, but THE OULET DOESNT WORK. Plz help.
How is there not a @Delta sky club at the LAS airport? V disappointed.
@Delta on my confirmation my first and middle name appear without a space. Is that going to cause any issues?
Thank you @Delta for getting back to me and resolving the issue. The speed of your response to the tweet was commendable. Thank you
@Delta TU for rewarding nearly 30 yrs as a priority mem by not assigning a seat to my minor child flying w me, checking w 4 different agents via phone, ATL custom service n 2 gate agents so she wouldn’t be alone n still impossible. FF ticket got me the last row 20 away from her
Big thanks to the @Delta MSP Team on New Year's Day for so quickly retrieving our checked bag for our rescheduled flight! Much appreciated
Hey, @Delta I changed my emoji...
@Delta boarded a flight to Toronto. I was # 1 on upgrade list the doors closed and there are two seats open in first. I’m diamond and been a loyal customer to Delta since 2010! What a joke
@Delta On Xmas Eve, I was at RSW for my flight back to MSP and, after repacking bags to get below Delta’s generous weight limits, inadvertently ended up with a prohibited item in my carry on. Thanks to Lisa for helping me sort this out, which involved checking another bag.
@Delta Im a 💎&amp; I busted my ass last year to make diamond just so I wouldn’t have to sit in main while flying guess what my very first trip of the new year it’s happening so stop thanking me for my loyalty when it means absolutely nothing! #💎meansNadatoDelta. 2366533970
@Delta when will rollover MQMs post in the app?
@Delta I booked a trip on Expedia... it’s listed at a KLM flight operated by Delta, would I get normal mileage or KLM partner mileage/MQDs?
@Delta I am 497 Miles short to maintain my Delta Airlines Silver Medallion, although I far exceed the dollar expenditure requirement! Delta wants $299 for a bundle to maintain Silver Medallion Status! Craziness. Time to research other airlines..!
@Delta love the lounge at DEN! Super attentive staff &amp; the space is always impeccable. This morning’s crew is particularly cheery &amp; welcoming, from front desk to floor team. Can kudos be passed along to the whole 7:45 am group?
@Delta I'm Medallon holder for you airlines and as of today I'm canceling my Delta Lounge access and will no longer fly with you. Denial of any kind of support animal based on breed is wrong in my eyes. I'm sure you don't care but that's me.
@Delta Yes originally it was delayed 15 mins due to ATC. We were then delayed another 35 minutes due because the pilot/crew missed our designated takeoff time. I get that conditions occur, but missing a takeoff time without reason is another situation in it's own
@Delta Hi, So I applied for the status thinking I lost status by falling short on spend this year after a new baby. My travel picks back up next week but I see I still have silver until Jan 31st?
Great start to the new year on @Delta this morning. There’s no sarcastic punchline about annoying air travel, it really was great and thought everyone should know!
@Delta hello Delta I’ve been a loyal priority customer flying out each time from SJCto Atlanta,Ga never once a problem leaving SJC through TSA Not once every time very professional and accommodating. The total opposite is what I have experienced with your connection flight to ..
@Delta Hi There, I have a question regarding the Reclaim My Status Program that I am hoping you can help with.
@Delta I really freaking love delta the best crew members they had. Shout out to Shannon a crew member that was very polite and helpful... Flight info is DAL950: BOS to PUJ Boeing 737-900 ship # 3865
@Delta I tried. Kept getting the runaround. Can you help? My cell is 6785202390
@Delta I had an amazing experience with one of your employees today, Yemi. But your Rochester, MN employees are terrible and do not meet the minimum expectations of customer service. In my experiences, they lie about public information and are very dismissive to their customers.
S/O @Delta. Always taking care of military when I fly... TSA pre check, free checked bag, and upgraded my seat at the gate. Appreciate you!
@Delta my son just left his AirPods in a gray case on the plane. We just got off of DL1572 from Atlanta to Tampa. Any help would be wonderful.
it’s been 1 hr since I was supposed to board my flight. every single update about the delay has been about the plane “making its way from across the airport” @Delta how long does it take for a plane to get to it’s gate if it’s supposedly already at the airport? RIDICULOUS.
@Delta can you pay the upgrade to fist class if your purchase your ticket using the companion pass?
@Delta do you really have a ban on Pit bulls ?
@Delta Thank you and happy new year, as well!
@Delta Disappointed No services made available to our team with disabilities at LAX . We had to walk our bags to Terminal 3 then walk back to Terminal 2 to board our flights. 🤔
When you are loyal to @Delta all year and are very close to reward status but for some reason they don’t count your last flight on Dec.31st 🤦🏻‍♀️ #almosthadyousilverstatus
@Delta special thanks to Bonita and Vanessa at JFK rebooking for helping me get home. Happy New Year
The pilot on my @Delta flight just shook hands with every single person &amp; said “good morning” 😩💕 MY HEART
@Delta How do I begin to explain my overnight connection ...hotel bill...arriving at my destination the next day....
@Delta sent a PM - our tag info is already on that thread. has been for a week.
@Delta, just when you think #GoldMedallion is a real step up, you run into this: #ComplimentaryUpgrades 72 hours in advance yea! ... unless the 2 available seats are blocked because ... airport upgrade ...special assistance ... not released before ... blah blah blah. #DL5250 🧐😐
@Delta hey guys! Me again! My flight out of GSO is delayed and I’ll miss my ATL connection to IND
@Delta hi and happy new year, i was checking my flight status and see a message that the schedule changed, but i don't see any change ?
@Delta our gate agent for DL655 on the 31st decided the best way to get everyone’s attention at the gate was to announce “the flight is cancelled...” after leaving enough time for us to start looking at rebooking, continued “now that I have your attention...”. That’s not ok!
@Delta Do you though? You certainly didn't show it for the lack of compensation for your mistake.
@Delta thanks for upgrading me and then changing it back to main right before I boarded🤔
@Delta Unrelated, but sitting in Delta lounge Milwaukee and asked TV channel to be changed from cartoons to Fox News. The Delta lounge person said they are only allowed to show ESPN or CNN because everyone knows Fox News isn’t legit. Is this Delta or local decision?
Hey @Delta, I just solved a problem in 5 minutes your customer service couldn't fix in an hour. That's not a good look.
@Delta wonderful travel experience through Atlanta with Adan Tikvesa. He was a true pro! Treated my family like royalty.
@Delta Thank you. Can you confirm you were able to direct me to Boston versus JFK since I will be missing my train given the emergency landing/delays? I see multiple flights out of ATL to Boston today.
@Delta No I did not mention it. Red eye flight, tired and just wanted to get off the flight at the end. Is it Delta’s policy to save partial cans of soda from a prior flight or was this an oversight or laziness with the crew on this flight?
@Delta 7:12pm ATL to Boston? Why so late???
@Delta I’m so happy that I was able to just make it over to Silver Medallion again! I was grounded in early 2019 over a health issue and it’s great that I’m traveling again! Happy New Year!!
@Delta okay - i was just kinda anxious about handing it over so abruptly im sure nothing i NEED is in there i always keep it in my carry on. Just it’s not a full flight and there was plenty of room it was just odd. I’ll keep this in mind they may do it next time I fly with y’all
@Delta Still waiting and looks like we will be a bit longer. Will DM depending on what happens at check. Doesn’t change my feelings about not using delta again.
@Delta been in line to check bags 40 min at MSP, still waiting and won’t make our flight with a toddler. Totally unacceptable and last time we will fly with you. Woefully unprepared for holiday travel.
@Delta BTW both of the answers I received looked pretty canned. Am I being answered by a bot?
okay so im basic economy boarding last and they made me check my very small rolling bag and there was so much room in the overhead bins?? and it was complimentary but seems unnecessary considering there was plenty room &amp; now i have to rush to baggage claim after we land @Delta
@Delta Be ready for a lot of missed flights and rebookings.
help @Delta or I may not consider you for future travel in 2020 based on 2 bags being destroyed on 12/21/19 DL 3598. 4 different Delta people provided 4 different processes to claim damage. No response so far. #customerservice is #awful
@Delta How do I let gate know I am stuck but here at airport bag check?!?
@Delta Been here since before 5am and no curbside per 2 other Delta staff. Where is it located??
@Delta What happen to curbside bag check???
@Delta Waiting for to board DL1576 IAD to SEA; delayed boarding due to no flight attendants. Why? No weather or traffic problems in area.
Love pulling my iPad out of the seat back pocket to find melted chocolate clogging the charging port. Brand new iPad won’t charge now. Do better @Delta
@Delta the affected flight is GIG-ATL, operated by Delta, which is now grounded at Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago. This will make us miss the next flight and a train.
@Delta just booked flights through Virgin with you, paid for comfort plus but when I go to seat selection I can only choose main cabin? Any reason I cant choose what I have paid for?
@Delta I won’t, boarding closes in four minutes and there are still 16 people ahead of me with only two people working at the desk but it is what it is
About to miss my flight because I’ve been in line for 45 min trying to check in at RDU @Delta
@Delta You know what weary travelers don’t want to hear at 5am on Jan 2 in the lounge at JFK? A smooth jazz, muzak version of Frosty The Snowman.
.@Delta thanks for letting a diamond passenger travel with a broken screen where i could not watch a movie or turn the screen off to sleep.. excellent flight.. will remember this next time i choose an airline to travel
@Delta that is the flight that has us stuck in Trinidad and Tobago, yes.
@Delta Hi yes I am a sky miles member
@Delta DL0886. I just don’t know how it’s acceptable to basically be forcing me to check in my bag at 1 hour before departure because the counters are not sufficiently staffed for the crowd right now
@Delta So does this get delivered to my house?
@Delta We’ve now been redirected to line up at another set of check in counters with no employees staffing it at all. My flight BOARDS in 30 min to LGA. What is going on?
@Delta why are there only 2 employees checking bags at hartsfield right now...
What airline rewards program is better than @Delta ? I need a new travel home.
@Delta Just arrived DL30 ATL to LHR. Would like to highly recommend the stewardesses in the Premium Economy cabin. Think her name was Kim. Excellent, attentive service. Thank you.
ummmm one of the plane generators broke down and we are stranded in Trinidad and Tobago for 6+ hours until another one comes from Atlanta. sos @Delta
@Delta traveling with family as a gold elite member and being told by Narita ground staff that I can’t bring in my wife and 2 kids into the lounge. Really?
@Delta Hi! Thank you! It was just so strange. I fly to Europe on Delta between once and twice a month and always have incredible service, but this time it was just really off. Happy New Year!
@Delta I usually only use Twitter to complement amazing #Deltapeople but I just got off of DL64 from ATL to FCO and we had the, handsdown, most un-Delta crew I’ve ever had. They were cold, rude, inefficient and just not pleasant at all to anyone. It was pretty shocking.
@Delta But I don't know much about planes so maybe I don't understand why this is a problem. I'm sure you guys got this.
@Delta Like my first guess is to use solid state drives if you aren't already. They are affordable these days.
@Delta Thank you. I'll do it tomorrow. It's mostly about the entertainment services always stuttering during turbulence and sometimes restarting to the beginning. I feel like this is an easy fix. This is 2020!
@Delta I just filled out a survey you guys emailed me and it was very positive. But near the end of the survey, I realized I had some things to complain about and there wasn't any place to write about it.
@Delta why on a flight with 28 seats open can I see none of them when trying to change my seat? Also why can’t I upgrade from comfort to one, when on every other international flight I’m on upgrade list?
@Delta I chose my window seat from Paris to Seattle months ago and then you change me at the last minute to aisle? It’s the entire reason I chose it months ago. Flight full so I’m stuck. Second time you’ve let me down.
Why was it necessary for the @Delta gate agent to flat out lie about all overhead storage being full? We had to check bags, 4 overhead bins above us completely empty! DL1212.
@Delta is this your people or the airports? This is ridiculous. Did they need more than 4.5 hours advance notice?
Will not be flying @Delta until they repeal their illegal ban on pitbull-type dogs. It is unscientific, but, more importantly, illegally institutes a blanket ban by breed for a service dog.
@Delta delayed our flight from Denver to LAX over 2 hours for a mechanical issue. They could not have been nicer or more accommodating. We arrived safely. Thank you!
@Delta Thank you for the link and explanation! I just filled out the form. Fingers crossed!
@Delta screwed me over. I gotta work tomorrow and this “1am departure” flight still hasn’t even boarded. Run me my [compensation miles] check. 👏🏾
Y’all really lost my carry-on... @Delta
@Delta So, I just got delayed for about 4 hours on one of your flights. I'm now at LAX, missed my connection and have no where to sleep. Can you help?
You know what would be helpful in finding my baggage carousel, @Delta? If your app still showed the flight I _just_ landed on rather than deleting it in favor of trying to sell me an upgrade on my next scheduled flight in a couple weeks.
@Delta Thanks for sharing with leadership. If your cust svc person would have offered this I would be less annoyed. I got platitudes and dumb responses when I wanted results.
@Delta cancelled our flight for no reason... assholes
@Delta I want my air mattress to be a checked bag. Does it have to be in a suitcase or can the canvas storage bag be enough?
@Delta extremely disappointed in Delta customer svc. Our seats purchased in June thru Delta from SIN to INC were changed without notice. Now stuck in lousy seats for 6 hours with 55 min to change flights. Cust Svc NO HELP! If you can’t guarantee seats don’t offer them.
@Delta Why doesn’t someone else’s gift of MOM’s do that then ? I got a gift of a 1000 miles while I just needed 12. Can you please refund the fee charged for the miles gift.
Dear @Delta , thank you for not giving me my frequent flier Silver status because I was 12 miles short, I was way over on the MQD’s but just 12 miles short on the MOM’s. Even though I got 1000 miles gift last night, you still didn’t count it towards my MOM’s.
@Delta I’m only here because it was free :) I’ll be back flying on y’all next time👌🏾
And ironically I did a similar thing in an unnecessary odyssey between NY and Boston to reach my @Delta status...
@Delta Hey there, I am unable to change meal options for my flight from CDG to ATL. Could you please help?
@Delta Sorry Delta, was just a joke...as I was reseated with my parents after changing my seat to be a few rows away from them 😂
@Delta Hi! I just got my boarding pass for my flight and it’s not showing my precheck. Are you able to look into this to see if I need to arrive an hour earlier? Thank you!
Changed my seat to be a few rows away from the parents on the flight versus right next to them... scan my ticket, gate agent tells me I have a new seat assignment.... well well well @Delta. $195 short on missing my status AND this treachery.
@Delta I’ve already had snack but still hungry. What can I do?
@Delta Happy new year! So where goes my dinner? Lol. Still hungry on board.
@Delta I’m taking a flight from Honolulu to ogg airport tomorrow which I booked through you guys with my other flights but it’s a Hawaiian airlines flight. I got a notification that my boarding pass was ready but on the app I can’t check in or view any flight information
@Delta once again flight attendants allow non delta comfort passengers to seat in comfort plus with no charge. JFk to Lagos flight number DL0214. This is the second time it’s happened why should I pay more. Time to try other airlines when flying to Lagos
DL2621. @Delta FAs are great. Though I kinda looked forward to the dinner in first class...lobster and rock shrimp ravioli. But sadly no dinner in flight :( so hungry now
@Delta is there a way to add my known traveler number to a flight I already booked? Just forgot to add it when I booked.
PSA: @Delta doesn’t put puke bags in seat back pockets anymore, so be prepared 😅
@Delta my flight itinerary is mavdlo (Angus Pryor) but online it won't let me do seat allocation - some error. Any ideas? Thanks
35,000 feet up with @Delta + movies on my seatback = perfect reason to go in airplane mode.
@Delta hi, all my medallion stats reset to 0 today. I was under the impression that some would roll over?
Thanks @Delta for randomly assigning my family of four throughout the cabin—even though I paid for a fare that would let me choose seats, and plenty of adjacent seats are available. I’m sure a stranger will enjoy chatting with my 2-year-old. #flightmares
@Delta pros: flight staff did an amazing job keeping everyone as happy as possible on a long delay; cons: over 3 hour delay on my vacation due to plane maintenance issues.
@Delta Carter was the flight leader on my flight today 1947 MSP to LAX. He was excellent ... with customers, his co workers and was really great was kids. Please make sure he is recognized.
@Delta Yes you all have WiFi which cost extra money, runs up my data and so on. Now I have another 2 plus hours on a plane with terrible connection service and I have to pay for it also. Upgrade me some miles for another day of no entertainment. It is 2020 get with the times.
@Delta 6th segment in a row now without entertainment on board. DL1674, DL1720 on today's flight. So very displeased with the aircraft I have been flying on. No one likes to stare at walls or back of seats on planes. This is bad business. Every plane should have TVs.
@Delta what’s the point of being platinum and having priority tags on my luggage when they throw them off the plane when there’s a weight overage? 😡😡
Thanks, @Delta, your personal lose my baggage! #sucks
@Delta It has now been two hours. I thought the “sky priority tag” was supposed to escalate the delivery of bag times? This is absurd. Y’all have known the plane full of people and luggage were supposed to land at noon - you had 6 hours to prepare to unload luggage.
Hey @Delta I thinnnkkk it’s time to retire the plane that took me from XNA to ATL yesterday. Everything was broken. The window shade, the fan, the seat back pocket, the lights above seats, the overhead bin was insanely tiny, etc... Pleassseee send a better option🙏🏼✈️
@Delta It’s now been almost 2 hours - still waiting on luggage. Weather is not the issue. This is clearly lack of preparation and people.
@Delta - took my first flight with you from PHL-ATL-FLL = awesome job and flight crew. Your FAs are positive, warm, energetic and have contagious personalities. Keep up the great job! A refreshing change from AA!
@Delta I have spoken to your phone team and they told me the $225 is ridiculous and that I should just pay the published fee at the check in desk ...
@Delta hey guys, can I use my Delta skymiles to upgrade a flight on China Airlines? We are flying from HNL to BKK in October. How would I even do that? Do you guys make the flight arrangements?
@Delta They did reset but it did not work. It did, however, end my T-Mobile 1 hour wifi so I didnt even have that!
Thanks @Delta for holding DL665 (MSP 🛫 BOS) for me today! #SavedTheDay
@Delta Your web page link for Central America destinations quotes $30
@Delta looking for seat assignment help for an upcoming flight. Currently shows no seat assigned in Delta One for me
@Delta For two of us this will add almost $1000 dollars to our trip...
@Delta I as on flight 5985 from Sarasota to LGA on 12/30 and my luggage was trashed when I picked it up
@Delta All they told me was that the airplane does this because it’s old. So what do I do now?
@Delta You guys did so great today. From LAX to ATL. SkyClub terminal B... straight up rude at check in. They should be your flagship for your brand.
@Delta Thank You! I interacted with May over the phone.
@Delta We already had the flight. Just interesting how one situation is treated and another was not.
@Delta People are getting pretty pissy w no lugggage for FL2893. Where is it? Where’s an update?
@Delta y’all did me wrong by not waiving the 4 MQS segments left to move me to silver status 💔. Happy New Year anyways!!!
SOOOOOO angry right now @Delta 24 hours no info on the lost bags!!!! WORST customer service ever! Diamond status fail.
@Delta can you explain why it costs £50 for hold baggage for a nine-hour flight from London to Atlanta but $225 for the same bag for a 2.5-hour flight from Atlanta to Belize? Why don’t you publish these prices?
@Delta my mqm that I earned above my tier haven’t shown up yet, how long does it usually take? Thank you!!
Dear @Delta, One passenger has a nut allergy and none of us can eat the free almonds. Yet, my wife is allergic to dogs and we get a dog in our row. Thoughts?
@Delta I appreciate that. Kinda like taking a big drink expecting unsweet tea and it’s sweet tea.
@Delta Wow. I was 497 Miles short for Silver Medallion 2020! Delta wants $299 to keep Silver Medallion Status! Crazy!!! I easily exceeded the annual card expenditure requirement!
@Delta A huge “thank you” to your rep MAY, in Salt Lake, for helping me change my flight reservation. I need to get back to Detroit early to start a new role at work, and she found a way to make that happen. An amazing ambassador for your brand! My member# is 9427514741. Thanks!
My flight from Tokyo to Seattle on @Delta was superb. I felt like royalty in the new Airbus A330-900neo. The meals, the movie selections, the flight kit, and the amazing crew all made for an enjoyable flight... even in my lowly economy seat! 😆.
@Delta Happy New Year! I don’t have any MQMs in my account but should have around 10,000 roll-over. Will it take a while for them to be displayed?
@Delta They're saying service is not available in this area but the map i found on Google has this area covered
@Delta Thanks. Not possible to get all four tickets for the lower price on same reservation?
There’s a god damn Wolf on this plane I’m on heading home. This whole service animal thing is outta hand @Delta. No sudden movements this flight.
@Delta here are the subsequent delays for our original 9:20 AM flight which caught on fire- 4:40 PM, 5:30 PM, 6:15 PM, 6:51 PM, 7:05 PM. What are you doing to rebuild trust and rectify this? #AirSafety #fire #literallylit
@Delta Fyi. When Delta tells you to DM them ....they don't reply. #DELTAISAWEFUL
@Delta DM 45 minutes ago....No Response yet......
@Delta looking to purchase up to 4 tickets. Does “2 left at this price” mean I have to spend more per ticket if I buy all four at the same time?
Yo @Delta tell me why I paid $1600 for a 10 hour flight and my charging outlet that’s supposed to work, doesn’t 🙃🙃🙃
@Delta It doesn’t solve the problem
one of my goals of 2020 was to not misplace things 2 min ago i just found my airpods on the floor of the @Delta sky club things don’t change.
@Delta I thought my extra miles over platinum were suppose to roll over in 2020 towards 2021 status. Can you assist?
Hey @Delta , booked a flight for 2 passengers, just registered for tomorrow and suprisingly we are on 2 opposite rows. First time I see an airline company separating 2 passengers booking a flight together. And no way to change seat because flight is full, 7 hours flight, nice!
@Delta it is extremely unprofessional and inconvenient to change time and airport of departure without notifying your loyal customers. Currently in an Uber driving 3 hours to make this ‘potential’ scheduled flight
@Delta Thank for the heads up! Love the MQM rollover but y’all not rolling over either MQDs or Branded Amex spend is kinda BS
@Delta Fell short? Basically the “Red Coat” Constance told me she didn’t care if I flew your airline or not. I guess “keep climbing” truly means trying to LEARN what customer service ACTUALLY is!
@Delta Hi. I'm travelling to Dublin from JFK tomorrow and I need to order a special meal but I can't we to be able. Could you please help me? My flight number is AF3562. I need to order a gluten free meal and I can't eat onion either due to food intolerances. Thanks so much.
@Delta is by far the WORST airline . I booked a 6 am flight from Phf to Mia with a 3 .5 HR layover and my bags STILL are not here. The driver for delta called and said my bags would be at the hotel by 6...still no bags...
@Delta please pass along to ATL airport my disappointment that they no longer support mobile passport re-entry for int’l flights. This makes me consider alt airlines and airports for travel. Only adds unnecessary stress returning home.
@Delta Why did a flight crew not allow the passengers to sing The America Anthem as the best friend accompanying a deceased soldier left plane to go stand &amp; receive his remains &amp; honor guard in Atlanta? Against company policy to honor or dead fallen soldiers. Want ANSWERS.
@Delta I booked a roundtrip ticket using skymiles, but I'm unable to fly due to being sick. Is there any way to get any of those miles credited back? I booked a first class return.
This is the first time im on a @Delta flight &amp; there are no TVs or charging ports. I’m very disappointed.
@Delta How do I access the survey
@Delta I understand, just wish there was more consistency with this rule. Every other time flown standby, my bag arrives on the standby flight. That makes sense.
@Delta why wasn't I allowed to use my mileage toward an unaccompanied minor's travel?
@Delta Thank you very much. I appreciate the help and quick response. Happy New Year.
@Delta on this flight alone I counted 6 dogs. 4 not even in carry cases and 1 is as big as a full grown Doberman. Never flying Delta again 😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😡😡😡
@Delta I understand. But on Amex I can keep the same dates for lower price. Unfortunately I can’t use SkyMiles on that site.
@Delta Is there a delay for rollover MQMs to be applied? I have a 0 balance starting the year.
@Delta I thought MQMs rollover? When I look at my account today, that doesn’t appear to be the case.
@Delta Nope going straight to the lawyer with that because i allready have to with the flight wich got canceled on December 21.
@Delta what is the point of clearing someone for a standby flight when her luggage remains on the later flight?
@Delta I would like to request that Delta make an effort to make this up to me. This flight is very unpleasant, this woman reeks to high heaven. I don't think it's a reasonable situation.
@Delta It’s difficult trying to use the SkyMiles miles because makes no sense to exhaust that many from your site because it’s extremely higher thsn what amex gives me. same exact flights. Almost feels unfair. Thank you for your help.
Hey @Delta how is it possible that a plane wich landed at ATL at 6:15am was not ready and cleaned for a flight at 6pm? Now the flight got delayed because of that? Also nice job on loosing our seat reservation! Never flying again with you!
Hi @Delta, do you made something for honeymoon travel trip with a full delta roundtrip ? 🥳
Why is it that every time I fly, my TSA locks are always gone when I get my bags? @Delta Great service otherwise. Everyone was nice and helpful since I needed a wheelchair. #gettinghitchedtoday
@Delta Ok. So if it’s only delta correct?
@Delta I also took snapshot of the flights I’m trying to book. Not sure if o can share via email if needed.
@Delta #angrygrandmother Why pay unaccompanied minor fee if minor is put on wrong connecting flight!
@Delta oh come now! 1k miles away from platinum renewal, WAY more MQD’s than necessary, &amp; a SkyLounge member. And I get bumped down to gold. Really?
Hey @Delta I am in Tampa heading to LaGuardia NYC and there are WAY TOO MANY DAMN DOGS going on this flight. ENOUGH WITH THIS INSANITY
@Delta Thank you. There is a huge price difference booking between Delta website and American Express SkyMiles website. 1/2 price difference which is huge.
@Delta Can you provide a number I can call?
@Delta .... I saw that that was an option but there was no way spending $1000 was reasonable.
It don’t matter if we board the plane on time if we’re still being forced to sit on the tarmac for 50 minutes after everyone has boarded the flight 🤦🏽‍♂️ @Delta
I was *so* close to reaching status on @Delta now I have to start over completely.
@Delta I reviewed my app for my trip next week to see my qualifying miles, segments, dollars for 2020 all at zero. Thought these would be subject to a rollover? Made to Plat but Diamond. Did I miss something?
@Delta Route suggestion: Since you’re investing in making Seattle a hub, how about a Seattle - Delhi/Mumbai direct flight? Use the polar route. No one flies direct from Seattle to India. With Microsoft, Amazon, and others, this is an untapped opportunity!
@Delta may I suggest adding chicken nuggets to your sky club menu? Most toddlers won’t eat what you serve on a daily bases. I was asked to leave the sky cub because I deared to feed my child something different. BTW I paid $845 for my membership
@Delta stuffed into shuttle bus to take us to the plane only to have us sit on that bus on the tarmac. DL0107
How long can @Delta keep us inside the plane while fixing the landing system? It is now 3 hours and counting... #delta366
@Delta necesito contactar con atencion a clientes
@Delta flew home on DL1168, first class. This was our final leg home. Service in first class was nonexistent. Lunch came and no beverage service at all, before or after lunch! Better service going on in coach!
@Delta do I get roll up mqms as a gold medallion member? I was 5K to become platinum, I would hate to loose them. I would have thought that I would start the year with 20K or something
@Delta Is Wi-Fi free for 1st class?
@Delta Fortunately I have a face mask to wear for defense, but this is not a good experience.
@Delta Why is there only one check-in attendant at 18:30 on a busy travel day at the SCL airport? Ridiculous.
@Delta my miles didn’t roll over? Does it take some time?
@Delta I have been informed that there is no other seat. This person is coughing and may have the flu.
Hey @Delta 970 from TPA to MSP, the #Gophers just crushed Auburn so get ready to party on the way home!
@Delta hello! can i DM you about a seat change?
@Delta DL1674 terrible boarding process today !!! No organization at all.
@Delta Guys, I don't understand why I'm paying nearly $400 for two tickets from Atlanta to Miami and I can't even get my seats assigned until I'm at the gate. Do you really mean to tell me you're unable to assign me a seat even if I'm checking 24 hours early?
@Delta thank you for helping me find my id!
@Delta HELP I LEFT MY WALLET ON MY FLIGHT 1334 RICHMOND TO ATLANTA AND JUST NOTICED!!
How difficult is it @Delta to check &amp; make sure your planes are properly working before boarding all your passengers? What a nightmare the delta experience has been.
@Delta I’ve been sitting inside a hot airplane for 2 and a half hours from Mexico City to Atlanta, GA. It was announced that the flight is delayed for another 2 hours. What can you do about this?
Maybe I should get a job w. @Delta ground crew so that I can manhandle and take out my frustrations on people’s luggage. My Steve Madden heels, my makeup bag, a childhood memento and a gift from my boyfriend have been ruined. Happy New Year.
Our flight was scheduled to leave at 1:25 and now they’re saying 5:00PM??? It’s like 90 degrees on here and we’re forced to sit in it for 3.5 hours??? What is this service!!?!?? @Delta #Delta #BadService
@Delta I'm sitting next to someone who reeks of garlic and other smells, and is clearing her throat constantly. Is there anything I can do? It's a four hour flight from Seattle to Atlanta.
So this past week I was on first class on a plan with @Delta and omg the people sitting next were so annoying and rude. Like people humble yourself
Hey @Delta I'm trying to choose my seats on my flight and I was wondering if there's any way you can help me out. It's an A330-300 and my fiancé in seat 26J and I wanna be in 26H with him
@Delta my wife and I are flying in 2 weeks can I pay for a Porsche ride gate 2 gate please
@Delta when do my rollover MQMs and segments post to my account?
@Delta help! can i have telephone number in israel please!!
@Delta tell your flight attendants to treat all their passengers equally. The mom next to me was offered more wine &amp; when asking for a second drink they told me we were too close to landing. I’m 27 years old..not a child. The woman next to me also felt it was weird &amp; judgemental.
@Delta Just more terrible service at MEX. We’re waiting to go to Atlanta and I’m heading a plane caught fire with people onboard?
@Delta Thanks for making us wait 2 hours when you decide to change a landing gear after the entire plane has been boarded and waiting to take off for AN HOUR. Just more terrible service from #Delta
@Delta airlines - I understand that bad weather can mean diverting to another airport but why haven’t you provided food and water after 2 hours? My family is traveling with two little kids!
@Delta Yes, it's all good now. Just took way to long.
@Delta Really No pajamas on Delta One? Even United Polaris provides Pajamas! You guys can do better!
@Delta why are there 50+ people in the bag check lines and only one person working bag drop?
@Delta I just booked a flight for my husband and daughter. When I entered payment it must have defaulted to me, but I didn’t see it until I got the confirmation email. Best way to fix?
Hi, @Delta, do you have an update regarding the incident with Flight DL8817, today in Mexico City?
@Delta in Boston is the BEST service!! Thank you! #DL1247
@Delta is it possible for you to help me with a mileage refund?
@Delta sister-in-law waiting to board in Seattle for flight back home to Scotland via Netherlands (booked through KLM), just charged £56 to check in her case!! What gives?
Starting 2020 right with complimentary first upgrades on my trip. Loyalty pays. Thanks @Delta 💕
@Delta HJC, I am pleased to hear you will escalate the concern and address it. I am looking forward to a timely response.
@Delta hats off to Manuel in Toronto....he almost pulled off a miracle, however he put in some effort.
@Delta My parents are traveling to Mayo Clinic today and your accommodations for my Dad with his temporary disability have been awesome. Thank you! #proudtobediamond
@Delta What happened to rollover MQMs?
@Delta has officially lost me and my entire family as clients. The fact that your customer service agents would even think I would accept not renewing my Delta status because of 1300 miles is insane. 1300 Miles that was also purchased to ensure that I renewed my status.
Mumbai —&gt; New York direct @Delta flight, 15 hrs &amp; 58 mins, definitely needs smooth boarding.
@Delta Scratch my previous question. I have a new one: if I use part of the $281 credit on a flight in January, can I use the rest of the credit on another flight in February?
@Delta I ended up using the mobile app instead
Sending a huge THANK YOU to all those working with @Delta in Montreal &amp; Detroit yesterday to get us on new flights home after delays &amp; cancellations!! Truly appreciate everyone’s kindness on as hectic a day as NYE! Can’t wait to fly with you again soon! #DeltaForLife ✈️
@Delta thanks for the upgrade, starting the year off right.
@Delta One of the Choice Benefits is to gift Gold Status. It takes MQMs and $pend to qualify for any status NOT MILES! I would like to use the CB to gift gold
I wish every company that offers rewards would be like @Delta and not let them expire. Delta, thank you for letting me keep the miles I've earned. ✈️
@Delta I have been promised my bags would be delivered multiple times, yet 3 days later I only have one of three bags. I’d prefer to stop being reminded of my platinum status and actually have someone locate my bags. Literally made a Twitter to get a response, help me plz.
@Delta They will not reach gold on their own.
@Delta Correct. They are currently gold. I would like use a choice benefit to gift gold for 2020 program year (2/1/20-1/31/21) but it will not let me?
@Delta on flight DL1295.... You're costing me A LOT of money
@Delta - literally impossible to speak to someone about changing my married name on my sky miles account. Especially when I’ve submitted over a month ago via email the change 🙄
@Delta sorry phone went dead. How can I gist status to someone who’s stays expired 1/31/29 at the same level? Currently gold and want to give gold
One more flight @Delta before I got my Gold Status back. International flight in 5 days.... whatever happened to the extensions you guys use to do? #overit
@Delta I lost my AirPods in Atlanta 😥 01/01/20 DL5310 TYS-ATL and now leaving ATL-MCO DL1171. I’m hoping an honest person has handed them in, what a vacation I’m having! 😢😢😢
@Delta Am I able to use a waiver of the flight change fee from Amex? If yes, does the value of the credit go up to $481.60?
@Delta Help! I was just on DL5740 from SMF to SEA and I just realized I left my knitting bag on the plane! It is a small green camouflage bag with some cream colored yarn in it. Can you help me find it? I was in seat 12D. Now on KA20 with final dest in chiang Mai
Happy to report I have successfully not re-made Diamond status with @Delta. While I will miss being Diamond, this means I was successful in my attempts to fly less. I'd say maybe I won't re-make Platinum in 2021, but I already have enough rollover miles...
@Delta meal question, so I preordered the grilled salmon for my flight from ATL-SLC tomorrow night. After researching that meal I can’t tell if it’s a hot or cold meal, could you confirm please?
Anchorage-Toronto $166 o/w @Delta . Fly 1/22-3/2 ($179 o/w return YYZ-ANC). #Airfare911
Hello @Delta have question. Check your DMs
First experiences with @Delta in the past week and can’t say it’s been good. Rude staff on the way out, delay on the way home 💪🏽
@Delta please consider giving me gold status for 2020, it’s 1/1 and I was 271 MQMs short and $50K over on Delta AmEx. I want to prioritize flying Delta in 2020, please help I want to be loyal.
@Delta Thank you, sent you a DM.
@Delta Hey Delta - Any chance of you guys pulling more GSP-MSY flights together for the #CFBPlayoff game? Lot of #ClemsonFamily looking for flights down there that aren't $1000+
Had the best @Delta pilot’s on today’s flight from MSP to BOS. They were so welcoming, funny, and kind. 😊🙌🏻
@Delta My bad, I bought it in March ‘19 not March ‘18. The confirmation number is JLUN56.
@Delta What a awesome tripulacion in flight DL0438 JFK to Cancun today. Everyone was so kind!
@Delta happy new year to you all . Flew with you guys during holidays , there was a significant delay on 23rd but your cust service team handled it beautifully . As a cust , I do understand the challenges with the flights &amp; what really matters is how your customers are treated
@Delta Happy new year delta airlines please bring non stop flights from LAX to IAH
@Delta My MQMs didn’t carry over to 2020 but I have status 😳 Help!
@Delta That is fantastic. Thanks and happy new year.
Hey @Delta I need help with something!
@Delta Appreciate it. We also appreciate the seat upgrades. Thank you.
@Delta why are my rollover MQMs not showing up in my Skymiles profile??
@Delta Boston to JFK flight 1088 leaving now. Air above seats in 1st class only has 3 options. Closed, wide open, or partially open while making loud hissing noise. Not a big deal obv but something worth looking into
@Delta No. You guys have great customer service. Love flying with you, but Planes specifically out of south bend regional airport always seem to have issues.
@Delta using companion cert. so booking 2 reservations for a fam of 4. If I link reservations can all member get 1st bag checked free?
@Delta great customer service at MINNEAPOLIS from Scott at Priority baggage claim! My daughter left her fanny pack and he ran back into the airport to get it for her! #delta
@Delta please upgrade your fleet. Traveling on two 5+ hour segments back to back where half the screens don’t work and seats are hard as rocks is really annoying.
@Delta Sounds good! How can I look into purchasing that service?
It’s 2020 and @Delta still sucks
@Delta Since you've asked for receipts and details so many times, I'll remind you: I'm only requesting reimbursement for $511.24 of out-of-pocket expenses while my bags were lost for 5 and 7 days. Now I've spent 31+ hours on this issue. It's truly the LEAST you could do.
@Delta so far, the pattern on Facebook is that I receive a message like this promising action or review from a representative, then nothing happens. I've been told many separate times that this is being reviewed, so review should be done by now - unless I've been lied to again.
Looking at the #ces2020 schedule, there might be a robo-flight attendant announcement by @Delta 🤞
@Delta - Good morning. I am traveling with my family (2 minor children) on Delta 1206 from LAX to ATL. GPETWQ. We currently have four middle seats, all on different rows. Any way we can get two groups of two?
Hi @Delta - after some gentle persuasion from one of your pilots, I have been flying with you more regularly. Excellent service again today, especially Tanya who was looking after us. Please pass on our thanks and appreciation. MCO - LGA - departed 10:54 ish.
This was my first and last flight with you. 2/4 I'm so glad I didn't fall for that bullshit credit card gimmick on the plane. It would have been a waste. Sorry @Delta I didn't mean to cheat on you, I was tempted by the low holiday rate.
Thank you @Delta for having in flight entertainment. Today on our flight from PHX to MSP we will be cheering on our MN Gophers! ❤️
Glad I didn’t pay for WiFi on my nearly 5hr @Delta flight from MCO-SLC. The WiFi didn’t work until we started our descent.
Thanks @Delta for great service! Delayed flight out of LAX last night meant running to our connection in Detroit. Luggage didn't make it, but delivered to our door this morning. Very happy.
@Delta we’re expecting a full refund. Our departing flight was delayed hours, returning flight engine catches fire, panic, opens emrgncy ext
Wondering why those of us on @Delta flight 8817 at MEX going to JFK were left on the plane for a full 30+ minutes after the plane caught fire. The slides were deployed but that actually kept us on the plane longer instead of helping us exit. #AirSafety #Delta #literallylit #fire
@Delta Looking forward to flying with you ✈ Happy New Year 🎉💫
@Delta on 396 and going to be late. Any chance of gate pick up?
@Delta Will it make my status Gold for 2020 if I purchase the 9 segments?
@Delta I’m taking the flight 104 to Atlanta tonight and then flight 886 to JFK on 3/1. Is my luggage staying at the airport for 24 hs Layover?
DL3877 flight attendants were super friendly on the way to Seattle this morning. Nice start to our morning. Thanks, @Delta #fqtv #travel #happynewyear
@Delta I have a question about my flight tonight from Gru- Atlanta -jfk
@Delta Is there any way to still purchase segments to go towards my 2019 segments? I was only 8 segments short to make Gold for 2020. I see I can still purchase segments but wanted to make sure it would count for 2019. I thought I submitted it and it didn’t go through.
@Delta I can’t even trust that tonight I’m going to get home, I’m so heart broken. I’d have hoped a big company would’ve been able to in the very least give me a hotel room.
@Delta can you help me with Choice Benefits questions?
@Delta Hello. We need an urgent assistance.
@Delta I’m honestly so upset with your company right now. I’m a first time flyer stuck by myself in another country, alone, and your company won’t compensate me at all.
@Delta Sent info in a DM HBB
@Delta I wanna be Diamond!😊Technically I missed it by $16 even tho I bought a $2400 ticket yesterday. Tomorrow’s my birthday! Can you help??
Happy New Year to everyone ESPECIALLY Janis at the @Delta Sky Club at MSP this morning who helped me avoid a 4+ hour layover and get home earlier. Sending good vibes Janis’ way in 2020 🎉 And, sure, Happy New Year to everyone else 🍾
@Delta is the use of an inflatable footrest for a toddler in the maincabin ok? Thx in advance
@Delta Excellent service from Kelly up front on DL 806 BOS-LGA this morning 1/1, great way to start off the new year!
@Delta huge line at #MSP just to drop off bags after ticketing. Not impressed.
Our @Delta flight 8817 just caught fire as we were pushing back from the gate at Benito Juarez International Airport (MEX). There was a small child in my row and she was terrified. There was immediate panic on the plane as well. #AirSafety #Delta #fire #literallylit
Flew back on @Delta Sunday, a direct flight DEN-JFK that we got to the airport in plenty of time for, and yet our suitcase is still ‘delayed’ three days later. HAPPY HOLIDAYS #lostluggage
@Delta good morning! I need to change a flight for next week but system will not allow. Did something change?
Yo @Delta you suck. I had a bad experience with you. Hit me back.
@Delta Done. Sent you the details.
@Delta Phasing out? They should already be out. Have you heard of #jetblue? This never happens on #JetBlue. So glad I paid for a first class seat (4B DL 2958 ATL-AUS) to have zero perks on an old old plane, fully equipped with flight attendants with bad attitude. DO BETTER.
@Delta Do we get loyalty points before the flight or after the journey is been completed ? I’m travelling from Cancun to New York. I wanted to know if I could use loyalty points for Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Please get back to me soon as possible.
@Delta This is my third flight with you in 2 weeks. I have had incorrect name on my tickets and now am seated in middle when I selected aisle weeks ago. Did not find this out until I checked app at gate; saw diff seat than boarding pass. 3 phone calls in 2 weeks re name now this.
@Delta still flying the MD90 with NO personal inflight entertain systems. It’s 2020. Do better.
6 legs, and 10,089 miles over the last 51 hours- hello platinum! @Delta #mileagerun BOS-JFK-SEA-BOS-LAS-ATL-BOS
Hello Delta, there is a security vulnerability in your company and this vulnerability is used to steal the company's money, @Delta
Meant to tweet this Monday, but thank you @Delta for another perfect record of kind, helpful employees and a great flying experience. My favorite airline.
@Delta Thanks but I was able to update my profile to include my KTN while standing in line to check my bag, then got a new boarding pass from the Agent who took my bag!! A small panicky moment, and I thank you for reaching out to me!
Why is @Delta First Class so inconsistent service wise? No pre departure beverages offered nor explained in FC. Come on there was plenty of time and not running late. I expected more starting 2020.
@Delta why am I getting charged a checkin fee for international flight?
Amazing flight and crew on DL 964 yesterday. Thank you as always, Delta! @Delta
Happy New Year!!! Thanks for the upgrade for our flight home to NYC @Delta! 😁
@Delta help! I have delta sky miles on an am ex card. How to I get them in to my delta account please?
Hey, @Delta! I'm stuck in Detroit because you couldn't hold a plane for 5 minutes while 7 people walked from a delayed plane that y'all broke. I'll accept my refund in the form of the work attendence points you're going to cost me. Happy New Year!
Its new year lets start off going DTW to MSY via MSP. Upgraded on both @Delta flights. Settling in for the first leg now and the flight lead on #DL820 is doing a great job. #AllstateSugarBowl here I come.
@Delta I am in the process of drafting a letter detailing all of the events and incompetencies of this trip. I will gladly DM you when I finish. The holidays are expectedly busy, but certainly is no excuse for the neglect of your passengers, which included children and elderly
@Delta Oh, cool. Thanks for the quick response. Happy New Year!
@Delta I'm traveling with family &amp; had no upgrade requested so we could stay together.I reprinted BP at skyclub and didnt even realize the gate agent bumped all of us up to comfort+ in single row until we got on and looked at the seat. Pls tell gate agent at e17 dl2735 thank you!
@Delta my miles didn’t rollover towards this years status?
@Delta Thanks, I will do this.
@Delta Yes, so how come my bag gets taken and when I ask them to measure the dimensions they refuse? It clearly was the appropriate size - I measured last night and the bag was meant for carrying on a plane. Idk why you have guidelines if they aren’t followed.
@Delta G9HEHQ was my Conf #
@Delta DM sent. Thank you for your prompt response.
@Delta You can start by having your call center know the fact that your breed questions for service dogs are illegal, and have been struck down by the federal government. Then maybe train your staff because they were RUDE to a guy with a cane while trying to get into his seat.
Yo. Fuck @Delta for A) treating disabled peopl like trash. and B) putting a pet dog DIRECTLY behind me and Atlas on this flight. Poor planning.
@Delta I just had my bag taken from me because of it “being too big” however on your website you say anything 22 x 14 x 9 and that’s what my bag was. Your employees were super rude about it and did not measure it.
As a Diamond Medallion and 1 million Miler I can’t believe the poor customer service I received from both Delta and Delta Vacations while trying to change my flight because of an urgent matter @Delta
Delta airlines should warn Diamond Medallion members not to book with Delta Vacation.. @Delta
Hey @Delta nap pods in lounges when?? Plz and thank u 😴
@Delta Always been happy with the service you provide, until checking in yesterday at Heathrow. Not sure why the female security officer at Check in treated us extremely rude and obnoxiously. Basic manners dont go far this day and age. She needs to learn some.
Delta should warn Diamond Medallion customers that your status doesn’t count when you book on Delta Vacations. @Delta
A huge thank you to @Delta for their help yesterday. Flight got delayed, they helped rebook, find me accomodations, and their staff on the flight were amazing. Huge thank you to the pilot on the jac to ATL flight
@Delta Wow! Delta always delivers with their boarding music every month. It’s amazing! Happy New Year to everyone working for Delta today 🎆 #deltaproud
@Delta not allowing a gold medallion member the option to upgrade on basic ticket after YOU changed my flight time is penny wise and pound foolish
@Delta this would have been helpful information BEFORE i missed my flight.
@Delta I sent you guys a DM!
also, @Delta i got to my gate on time but you left 6 minutes early.. how is this MY fault?
@Delta An additional person came on. Thank you!
On flight DL199 from Seattle to South Korea. Credit where credit is due, Jay is a fabulous attendant/purser and has really made this flight a comfortable and enjoyable experience. Downloading wi-fi specifically to give him a shout out! #deltairlines @Delta
Happy New Years everyone! @Delta was supposed to drop my bag off today by 8pm, but then called and asked if I’d be around at 12am on NYE!!!! If you guys need a date just ask!! but I do need my bag #joke
@Delta I did that; thank you. Please check your DM and respond to me at your earliest possible convenience, please. #ThankYou
@Delta Why does no one work at the SLC check-in/bag drop counters until 4:15??? Thank goodness I showed up 2 hours early...
@Delta I paid for two first class seats and an employee suggested we change plans because of a mechanical issue on our original flight. I would like to be reimbursed the difference, as I am not currently flying first class on the flight. #PLEASEandTHANKYOU
.@Delta continues to prove they’re the best, thanks to a super fast solution via Twitter. 🙌🏼
@Delta I’m traveling in First Class to MSY at 9:45a.m. Without a membership to Delta Sky Club. Does my ticket include the lounge access?
@Delta Good to know. Thank you.
Yo @Delta can we get some agents at the counter in IAH? Lots of people are here two hours early for the 6am with no one to assist. Thank you.
@Delta Ah! Ok, thanks. Was worried for a second! I was so close to gold this past year.
So I thought @Delta carried over MQMs if you were short for a tier to give you a headstart on the next year?
@Delta 🙌🏻 must have missed the memo- thank you!
@Delta ...you had the opportunity to be so nice and you blew it. Active duty soldier flying with his new wife to their first duty station and your attendant thought it was okay to be as rude as possible to them about her carrying her wedding dress back to Seattle wow disappointed
@Delta help! My extra MQMs did not rollover into 2020 ! #panicked
@Delta flying with you from Jfk to Lhr on 19/1. How can I upgrade my seat? No option under my booking.
Thank you @Delta for reissuing my ticket with the correct name. 😊🙏
Deep breaths. Do not rant on New Year's Day about @Delta axing NRT &lt;--&gt; SIN and this absolute clusterfuck in ICN.
@Delta I was 100 miles short but thanks 😂
@Delta thanks for resetting my MQMs to 0 😂 #2020
@Delta What’s the deal with airline food
La PEOR experiencia con @Delta. 11h de retraso!!! No puede ser posible
@Delta From what I gather, Nigel is the only one who can help 🤷🏼‍♀️ and I kinda suspect he’s done working for the day. But thanks at least for your prompt response 👍🏻
@Delta Thanks. Sent the details in DM.
@Delta I can't find my trip in the app or on the website *after* I paid for upgrade. The customer care chat isn't very helpful. Where can I reach out for additional support?
@Delta Ah, i'm travelling from the U.K to the U.S, the flight i'm looking at uses KLM from MAN to AMS then transfers to Skywest DBA for the last two Legs [AMS - SEA - EUG], would the checked bags still go to the the final ticketed Aiport?
@Delta I'm thinking about Booking with you guys for travel to the US from the UK, but I have some questions about checked baggage and haven't been able to find any information online. It's mainly about checked bags in layovers.
@Delta I’m flying with you guys from now on!
@Delta I would like to discuss the policy with someone that has authority for overriding errors.
@Delta That’s great news. I’m praying that it holds true. Thank you. Happy New Year!!
@Delta Let me take photos of the planes! 😂🙏🏼 On a real note; thank you guys. You’re always helpful. Happy New Year!
Honestly, @Delta is my favorite airline. I’ve never had a bad experience with them.
@Delta as always I truly the amazing service from your crew members. Happy New Year to everyone at Delta Airlines. See you soon!
@Delta I’ve followed the account as well as provided my confirmation number. I look forward to hearing from a team member very soon. Thanks!
Biggest 2019 regret was missing Diamond Medallion on @Delta by 5000 MQMs. Everything else was a dream.
Ight nvm fuck you @Delta "Doors close 10m before departure" Departure listed 10 52. Go to bathroom. Come back plane gone Nice lol
@Delta DL3060 had a mechanical issue here in Detroit, they moved us to a smaller plane so had to bump a bunch of people. But bumped people are being well taken care of and all working folks are clearly busting their ass to get as many as possible home tonight.
@Delta Well, now that you mention it, the hotel shuttle the voucher was supposed to take care of has not shown up and we now have a small crowd accumulating in the cold waiting. Again, very disappointed with this year’s holiday travel experience
@Delta had issue changing international flt itinerary on app, but was nice to “talk” to support to get details on change fees over twitter. Would have been nice if change can be completed thru here as well (use card on file - Skymiles). Cell signal not the best in some
@Delta #NewYearsResolution #DELTASUCKS #Deltadoom #DontFlyDelta Been trying to get out of this city for 2 days now but to no avail. Too many operational issues. How can you not check for hydraulic leaks during maintenance?!
@Delta What is beyond your control? I didn’t change airlines.
@Delta I’m flying out of SLC tomorrow headed to MSY and there’s word of a winter storm. How far in advance will I be notified if my flight is delayed or canceled?
Usually a pretty positive person, but man, @Delta you ruined my New Years. I’ll let you enjoy your holiday and reach out Thursday. #customersupport
So disappointed in @Delta right now. Their Sky miles program is convoluted (at best), and while I’m short a mere 1,600 miles of the next status level, it will cost $900 to buy my way up to the next tier. No waivers.
@Delta my return flight was rescheduled due to your flight plans. Who can I talk to about this?
We are deplaning. Looks like #2020NewYear at the airport @Delta
@Delta if i’m active duty military and i’ve booked my flight with you guys, is there a way i can get through security quicker. like TSA precheck im on military orders as well
&amp; I cannot thank enough the lovely woman I first spoke w/ @Delta when I called! I do not know her name, but am forever grateful for what she set in motion. Meant the world to me, my sister and my nephew &amp; we will never forget the experience. Much love and happy new year! 3/3
@Delta I'd like to give a shout out to Flight 837. We arrived in Honolulu an hour early and the flight was great. Happy New Year!
We were COMPLETELY surprised by a text from Sheilagh @Delta VIP the morning of our flight (thought it was fake at first!). Sheilagh is a truly lovely, wonderful, thoughtful person who lifted our spirits and started our trip with such unexpected vip treatment. 2/3
@Delta will my mqm of 41,000+ miles rollover or will I lose them if I dont purchase enough to make gold status
Well, @Delta just torched my NYE plans, so will probably be on my own instead of with family. Delayed &gt;4 hours, can't guarantee we'll even be leaving tonight. Offered a whopping $75 voucher for the "inconvenience"...wondering why I should even bother keeping SkyMiles
@Delta Going to try for #diamond #skymileslife
@Delta NBD. Just letting you know!
Another day another @Delta upgrade 🙏🏽🥰
Dear @Delta. Is it possible to get in 22 segments or 8600 MQM to hit gold before 2019 ends? I may have waited til the last minute and, uh.....my bad
DELAYED 2 hours on New Year’s Eve at MSP to BZN. @Delta is bringing in another aircraft from JFK a really the only solution at a hub? Just another upsetting experience, every time I fly delta.
@Delta HAL4ZR we are finally leaving but I feel this is not acceptable. I am a platinum traveler and am traveling with an 11 &amp; 4 year old whol are not further delayed getting home and to bed. There is nothing to be done, just not very happy
@Delta Happy New Year to you all as well! 👏🏾🙌🏾✈️
Airlines for future flights. @Delta you need to find a way to remedy this situation and take care of your loyal customers. This was completely unacceptable and unprofessional on your behalf. Your customers are the frontline of your business and represent your entity. Find a way
Stature, I expect @Delta to provide better customer support and offer some sort of accommodation to help offset the additional purchases I had to make because of your error. I spend a lot of money with your airline, but this experience is greatly making me consider alternative
@Delta she was extremely disrespectful and not conscious to the fact that this was a MAJOR inconvenience as I obviously need my bag. Because of YOUR error, it cost me extra fees and additional money to acquire a ride home. I understand mistakes happen, but for a business of your
So I always fly @Delta and usually have a good experience, but you guys need to have a customer service seminar. I had a layover in Oregon, and my bag was left there. So I go to inquire about my bag and the customer service agent acted like it was my fault...
@Delta need help with my SkyMiles account
Special thanks to @Delta for making our night. Sweet flight attendant upgraded our seats bc he loved that my daughter was reading before takeoff. He was hilarious &amp; clearly loves his job/serving others. Flight 3805 from LGA to BNA. Wish I got his name - Happy New Year 🎉
I get to the airport and find out my flight is delayed until 6 pm.....it’s 7 minutes to 9 am 🥴. If @Delta sent notice of this major delay, I wasn’t notified through email or the app 😩.
1/ Worst customer experience I’ve ever had flying @Delta. My bags have been lost for 5 days and after waiting unanswered for an update I was finally just told #that there is nothing that can be done and my bags are gone.
Happy New Year to @Delta my new fav airline! From the kind agent at JFK gate B35 who just upgraded me, to their amazing service that allows me to travel with my dog as I move from LA to Amsterdam. You’ve made a stressful trip so much less stressful. Thank u!!
@Delta taking customer service notes from united airlines or what
@Delta how is my bag lost from Detroit to NYC when it made it all the way internationally from Indonesia to Seoul to Detroit with bag tags? How did you not scan the bag? An international bag that you made me re-check?
Flight was delayed 4 times and was eventually cancelled. Now I have to take a flight at 5:30AM from an airport 2.5 hrs away. Was refused hotel voucher or compensation of any sort. Extremely frustrating @Delta
@Delta sorry to bother. Just booked a flight for April and have two reservations somehow??
@Delta props to SeaTac gate agent Alex (A6) who saved me from losing 1000 husband points due to seat assignment. An excellent way to fly into the new year!
@Delta flight 2635 on January 10th. I bought this ticket long ago and now in a middle seat from atl to las. I choose this flight because I could get comfort + on the aisle. Unacceptable please correct this. I am currently in Mex or I would call. 2145108060
@Delta 2 of2 - dropped 75 yr old mom at LAX at 1 am w/little details. Put her on a 2 hr bus w/no food or water to finally be dropped at SAN at 4 am while still closed! And she’s a skymiles loyalist. How do u tweet those who u don’t favor? Tweet to fix!
@Delta cust svc in short supply on 12/30 flight 884 MSP to SAN. Delayed mom’s flight to wait for another late flight, asked her 2 move to a non recline seat so another passenger traveling with a large dog could have a seat, didn’t realize SAN was closed until descending
@Delta Jac-cmh Audrey Stanley Paul Stanley
@Delta super confused as was the person I spoke with on the phone. I am $386 away from next status...but if I act today and spend $900, I’ll get the next level? That math doesn’t make sense to me.
@Delta what is a dmn tsr?
@Delta, first off, love the ability to tweet from the app. Second, I just booked a flight and I have two different confirmation numbers and flights? Did it book the flight twice? Charge twice? I don’t know what happened....
@Delta how about some free upgrades since I had to cancel my last flight’s and lost my upgrades I paid for?
@Delta hi my upcoming flight FLL-BOS was modified and it said I can change it. Could you assist me with looking at alternative flights on either 1/3 or 1/4? It says I cant modify online. Thanks
@Delta literally the worse flight attendants I’ve had ....
@Delta can you help with a booking I have?
@Delta I would like to speak to a supervisor.
@Delta Thanks worldclub helped me. I’ll be in touch for return. Ugh can’t believe I booked wrong flight
This year I flew 65,000 miles—about 40% less than in previous years. I lost @Delta Diamond Medallion (first time in 7 years!😩) but hoping to reclaim it around May-July. All of this is worth it, however, as I have my son Lorenzo at home making me so happy! 2020, bring it on!
@Delta Despite a late arrival into DTW making for a very tight connection, my bags made it to CHS! Your Baggage Handlers do an awesome job!!!
Hey @Delta I would like to DM re customer service issue.
@Delta have you discontinued the DTW-HNL non stop route?
@Delta can I please get on different flight? Mine is boarding but want to try the 5:59
What a shameful performance from @Delta, who, up to this point had always felt like a fairly reliable airlines.
several hours at NAS. All the while passengers were left in limbo with the gate agents hiding out in an area restricted to the passengers. @Delta continued to push our flight back knowing that it had already lost our faith and continued to move us from gate to gate forcing us to
Absolutely inexcusable experience with @Delta this weekend. A direct flight from NAS to MSP turned into a disastrous 26 hour travel day. Several major logistical errors and horrendous customer service issues led to our entire flight being cut off from food and water for
@Delta unbelievably disappointing experience with your operation at Jackson hole today. 3 hour delay due to an inability to calculate our payload??? Missed connections for everyone. Happy new year.
@Delta You have a customer service representative named Britney J. who is absolutely amazing! She restored my faith and loyalty with Delta and I want to ensure I recognize her for her above and beyond efforts!!!! Great job!
@Delta Thanks-usually my experience is pretty good.
@Delta Just another reason to abandon loyalty to Delta. Loyalty worked in only one direction.
@Delta new A220 seats (Comfort+) don't stay reclined. Slowly slip to upright. Quite a bother. Is there a fix?
@Delta Thank you for your help. Looking forward to hearing back from your team.
Hey @Delta - kind of wondering why the couple in 5AB who were HIGH and threw contraband down the front commode, causing an hour maintenance delay on flight 2264 to ATL, weren’t immediately booted off the plane? Was it bc they were white? #IHaveQuestions
Plane has john wick 3 and breakfast club and Bombay like good for u @Delta
Attention @Delta fliers. R there any discount codes u are aware of? Is there a way to get a discount if u book multiple flights at a single time? Any suggestions, ideas or contacts would be appreciated. Thank you. #delta #deltaairline #deltaflights #deltadiscounts #promocode
@Delta I’ve always had a great service experience with Delta until today with Romy. She told me to call back and speak to another associate who would transfer me to another Supervisor. When I did Nat was amazing and at least tried to help me sort this out. I still have no tix
Hey @Delta my luggage was supposed to “meet me in Atlanta” according to the gate agent who switched my flight yesterday due to weather. At 12:48am and 8:19am today its status was “bag to be set up for delivery” but still no call and no bag. I can’t get a human on the phone, help!
@Delta your customer service Associate’s were helpful, however your supervisor Romy in Cincinnati was rude, abrupt with little compassion and did not offer any solutions to help my situation. I’m out $477, I won’t make my 3pm flight &amp; therefore won’t make platinum status.
@Delta really need some attitude adjustments for gate agents e37 atl to Madrid today. No one likes to be barked at.
@Delta very disappointed. I’m a loyal sky miles member and just had an unfavorable experience. I was booking a $477 tix with my delta app so that I could hit my MQDs and make platinum status for 2020. The tix never confirmed but my credit card was charged.
Hey @Delta where is my bag? It was supposed to be delivered this morning.
@Delta We actually made it to Atlanta with minutes to spare! We ended up having to wait on our lead flight attendant! Thanks, Delta!!
@Delta we’ve been sitting on the plane waiting to take off for 2.5 hrs...how about some complimentary Skymiles?
@Delta Thank you for the quick response!!
@Delta I do need further assistance. What’s the best way to get on the phone with you (not your huge call center)?
You know a lot of people complain about United Airlines and American Airlines but let’s not forget to include @Delta They lost our bags for the first 4 days of our trip. 2 different cities and no change of clothes. Now they lost our bags now that we got home. Well done folks!
Really @Delta ? Stuck 3hrs on a plane for a maintenance issue before take off yesterday and now already an hour for another one on today’s flight? Do your planes work? NYE plans already affected 😭
@Delta is the only good airline.
Officially done flying with @Delta 🙃
@Delta it's been 20+ hours for our delayed baggage with absolutely ZERO compensation is ridiculous. 50 minute phone calls with your representatives and zero outcome is definitely being noted.
@Delta My case number is 03210639.
Holy shit snacks. Traveling home for the holidays, I lost my license. @Delta found my license and is mailing it to me. Customer for life now.
@Delta Confirmation number sent by DM. We understand there are perhaps admittance requirements but there is a manner in which those should be advised, &amp; it’s not to make us feel like we’re not the kind of customer Delta would prefer.
Hey @Delta. Our flight from LAN to DTW was delayed, so we missed our connection to GSP. Any options to get my family of 6 home tonight?
@Delta Travelling home via Boston Logan and went to visit Sky Lounge, where we were ‘informed’ that we were not of the correct calibre to enter the lounge! After a difficult flight out, and as first time Delta flyers, it would be unlikely we would consider flying Delta again.
Y’all scantless @Delta for having me on this plane with no tv’s and giving me the last seat in the back that’s how we gone end 2019 fr lol
Ughhh not one of our 4 checked bags made it on our @Delta flight out of STL this morning. They're getting into SMF late tonight and will be delivered tomorrow morning. At least they know where the bags are! #HappyNewYear
@Delta never received my Diamond medallion luggage tag with hitting status (nor for Platinum)! Can you send one?
@Delta Hi-IATA agent here with a HUGE problem, may I DM you, please???? Client is a DL Diamond!
@Delta Thanks for another shitty flying experience.
@Delta you may not know you have a saint working for you at BUR (DL3605) who found my laptop sitting all alone in the boarding area. This saint opened the laptop, figured out it was mine, then hand delivered it to my seat before takeoff. It’s going to be a great 2020! #grateful
@Delta WHAT THE HELL, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE 330 PM FLIGHT?!?!
@Delta why doesn’t my my boarding pass show tea precheck
@Delta my mom is travelling to JFK from Kingston and the customer service has been shocking!!!! It’s her birthday and we don’t even know if she’s made her flight and she’s now had to have special assistance!!! Mortified is an understatement.
@Delta Hello Mr/Miss/Mrs Delta, I’m like 3,000 MQMs away from Platinum. For Christmas this year, can you make me platinum? - Love, Craig Thompson
@Delta I drove to LSE this morning. I want to know what time my bag will arrive?
@Delta Ok, they have not arrived yet. Thanks. Lol
@Delta Nope. LSE. I wasn't going to spend another day at the airport side the next flight isn't till 330p today. I'm in LA Crosse now...
Hi @Delta. My skymiles appear to be tied to my old US address (UK-based now), and as a result it looks like I won’t qualify for medallion status. I get an error message when I try to add my UK address as my primary - how can I fix this so I actually get my medallion status
@Delta Was that 5:30 Brazil time or Eastern Standard time.
Dear, @Delta. I just landed from my final flight of the year and I'm tragically only 269 MQMs away from reaching Gold Medallion. Any chance y'all have one last 2019 miracle up your sleeve and can bless a guy heading into the New Year? 🙏
@Delta what does it mean, ”Service Request that requires you to check in at the airport”
@Delta Como me comunico en español ?
Tonight, as a nation watches its giant crystal ball descend into what I still believe to be the Cup Noodles billboard, I’ll only see my @Delta MQMs resetting at zero.
Flight delayed for 3 hrs because of a screw. New year eves plan delayed @Delta
@Delta I’m almost at Medallion status but I’m not flying to Africa until tomorrow the jan1 can I still qualify for medallion status?
@Delta I’m a plane in NY right now. I will call customer services tomorrow and have them take care of it
any ideas why @Delta power outlet isn't providing power to my MacBookPro?
#Bingewatching is the only way to do LAX &gt; SYD on @Delta. Thousands of hours of free entertainment, no sleeping necessary.
Flight delta 1637 made it about a tenth of the way to RSW before emergency landing at JFK due to engine warning light. Fire engines checking it out on tarmac. First an emergency landing for landing gear malfunction in 2006 and now this. DONE with @Delta
@Delta Flight from Greensboro to Atlanta this morning is delayed because of mechanical failure. Therefore didn’t make my connection from Atlanta to STL. So I was re-routed to NY LaGuardia. Currently sitting on tarmac waiting to take off from NY to STL. Now it’s delayed
Lost faith in @Delta as a trustworthy airline. Just cancelled the first leg of our flight for our honeymoon to Thailand so we will miss our connector; customer service has been zero help and offered us nothing. Devastated our trip we’ve saved for for years is being ruined
@Delta super confusion here as we board . Overwhelmed reps and no one knows what to do I know you are very busy, but you can be better
i've been congested since july, thanks @Delta
@Delta But I appreciate you looking into it
@Delta 20 min to make it between A12 and F9 in MPLS before the door closes. I’m not confident.
@Delta my family and I are on the flight dl4047. The power unit is not working. We are in first class. My son cannot get on wifi. Surprised with first class! Disappointing. Long flight to not be able to charge your phone battery.
@Delta I appreciate all your help. #Deltarocks.
@Delta after my flight was cancelled last night, now we’ve been de-icing for 30 minutes today and I probably will miss the last flight home from MPLS to LGA. Not sure anything can be done but this is disappointing. There are 6 people on this flight that will miss their connection
@Delta I’m flying KLM tomorrow as part of a flight I booked with delta. I have rewards American Express. Don’t I get to check a bag free?
@Delta Frustrated! Mechanical leads to delay leads to missed connection. Would have been great to have WiFi on the plane, so that I could rebook, but that didn’t work either. Auto rebooked to standby status on a flight that’s oversold isn’t helpful. Not feeling Delta today.
@Delta is the worst. How can the person dropping off 1800 miles away be the same person picking the kid up. Guy said he will help if I'm on hold by the time kid lands. #howrude #nightmare
@Delta Thank you for your prompt response. I hope you’re as willing to offer comps and/or miles IF we miss our connection in Atlanta.
@Delta it would be nice to know as early as possible if checked bags won’t be arriving at the intended destination with the passengers, at least an app notification. Whole flight has checked bags left at layover.
@Delta Thanks for your help I have sent you a direct message
@Delta Thank you for your assistance. I wish I knew this. 😊
@Delta So I totally understand the need to de-ice the plane. Now the pilot said mechanical errors when running tests for first flight of the day. We’ve been sitting ON the plane for over 1 hour. I’m all about safety, but this is sadly inconvenient.
@Delta why was flight 4115 diverted back to Detroit? We are getting mixed stories on the ground.
Hey @Delta ~ we’ve been sitting on the plane for an hour. How long should de-icing take, and what are you going to do for us when we miss our connection in Atlanta? This is ridiculous. #hurryuptowait #waitingisthehardestpart #crazy
Okay @Delta just to reiterate here: -Lost my suitcase because it was delivered to the wrong airport -Old coins and a ring (inherited from my late grandmother) were stolen from said suitcase Please AT LEAST catch the person responsible for the theft. Don’t red tape me here
Dear @Delta first time traveling your JFK-BOM non-stop flight and experiencing horrible hospitality. Cabin crews are insensitive and rude. They are ready to conflict with passenger. No sense of service or duty. I travelled a lot with Delta but never felt this. #Sad
@Delta Watched attendants on two flights fill the coffee pot with water from bathroom sink. Why can’t they use the bottled #Dasani water you contract with, instead of germy recycled water… Everyone around me avoided the coffee witnessing that. Avoid coffee on #Delta #DoBetter
@Delta hello, my flight to ATL on December 15 at 7:56 PM from GAINSEVILLE Florida, confirmation number G8BJME, my name is Nyjah JOHNSON Was delayed for approximately 6 hours! Causing me to miss importantly meetings. I am requesting a trip voucher as compensation for the delays.
@Delta Well we got through thanks to your wonderful agents can’t wait to get to Atlanta#thanks
Experienced racism on a @Delta flight about 2 minutes ago. &amp; the guy asked to be relocated and the flight attendant actually moved him 😭 Happy New Year eve. 🥴 let me say a prayer.
What I ❤️ about @Delta? I think hmm, clients should have their bags(it’s been 21 mins since flight completion). As I’m thinking, in comes the text we have our bags.
@Delta Having trouble checking in my other passengers for a flight tomorrow via mobile app. Can you DM to assist?
@Delta Now people behind us on later flights are passing us in the “priority” line because they pulled so many people out for our flight. THIS IS INSANE!!!!!
Never flying American again. Delay after delay. Sorry @Delta for cheating on you. It WILL NOT happen again.
@Delta So they tried to fix the entertainment by hard reset, but didnt work. what it did do was end my internet connection and now it wont come back. This is awesome!
@Delta No, the desk is still closed. I'm at the airport in Rio. Thanks for any help you can provide. We just want to check our luggage so we can relax.
@Delta We just got pulled out of line to pass the other people who have been waiting 2 hours in front of us. This is literally the worst check-in process I have ever experienced at an airport. We should have arrived 2 hours later to be pulled to the front rather than shoved aside
@Delta Looks like they got the message and starting getting things moving. Thanks for your help!
Another wonderful day of travel thanks to @Delta!! Been sitting on my plane for over 1 hr and now the pilot says we are likely going to have to switch aircrafts. 26 hours of travel now to fly 7 hours.
@Delta That’s great but we have to be in fr Lauderdale ON TIME for a reason.
@Delta Why allow for early check in and no one is at the window to check anyone. The app didn't give a time when passengers could check in their luggage.
@Delta How do i get that? It was December 23rd
Disappointed in @Delta . Trying to find a bereavement fare to go from ATL to STL on Friday - Sunday for my Uncle Jim’s funeral Saturday morning and was told the website price of ~$600+ is their best. No compassion.
@Delta Can you please ask the delta customer service here in MBJ to open up a desk for the regular check in rather than divert every single person to the people who arrive late?! There are a LOT of angry passengers who followed instructions that are paying for those that didn’t!
@Delta i sent the DM, and wow, thank u, i was just frustrated because i have always come up just short on mqs or mqms. I honestly didnt expect a reply, so thank u very much for looking into it
Dear @Delta: Our Delta Vacations experience was terrible. From seating problems to terrible customer service when we encountered trouble in our trip... You are my airline of choice for business travel but I will never book a vacation with you again.
I'm a Gold Medallion on @Delta for the third time. I'm 8000 MQM miles away from being Platinum Medallion for the second time. Delta offered to sell those miles to me for $1899. I do want to be Platinum again, but not that bad 😂.
@Delta can you help me change a reservation?
@Delta We’d like to take up the chain because that is unacceptable. The delay on your end caused us to miss the first day of our Honeymoon. And we have been told by our a travel agent you are liable.
@Delta Great! This worked! Thank you!
@Delta Okay can it be adjusted? I paid with my sky miles card?
@Delta Thank for you response been in line over 1 hour still not checked in flight leaves at 2:30
@Delta have been in line at MBJ for 1.5 hours now waiting to check my bag. The line is not moving because they keep pulling everyone behind out of line to check for earlier flights. Why should we arrive early if the people who arrive late just go straight to the front?!?!
@Delta what is UP in the SXM airport!?! Been waiting in the Sky Priority check in line for more than 30 minutes. Only 3 or 5 people were in front of me, but it is taking FOREVER!! Either need a faster process or more bodies in the desks.
Wow @Delta you’re really letting a plane sit for an hour all because some lady wants to take her dog in first class?? Flight 2396 to Fort Lauderdale is PISSED!! #delta
@Delta is my checked bag free with my sky miles credit card? I paid 60$
@Delta I do not need rebooking more help at desk is needed your agents are dealing with a lot of angry clients trying to check in
6am - Sac flight left for LA 7:39am - off plane in LA 7:54am - on return flight 10:03am - back at Sac @Delta #MileageRun
@Delta I did that! Can you tell me if Delta is operating from Leon Guanajuato Mexico? (BJX)
@Delta on a flight out of Detroit. We have been sitting on the tarmac for 45 min past our departure time because of a seating issue involving 4 dogs in first class that were all out of carriers. This is absolutely insane. Why is this even an issue to begin with
@Delta can you help with a Delta economy flight time change?
@Delta I think it’s be more efficient for everyone if I did it on the app.
@Delta been trying to make a change in my reservation, have registered for a call back twice but have not received it, what should I do? Need to change departure date
@Delta Canceled my SW flight and booked w/ Delta because was told by rep they accommodate wedding dress carry on. Went to special check in &amp; told no paperwork needed. Check in at gate. Told I need 1st class seat to get coat closet for my dress or I can get it if there is room. 😥
@Delta u lost all my stuff on New Years GG
@Delta Hi connect WiFi on what say you bought online how do you redeem on the airplane
@Delta I am $118 away from the next SkyMiles medallion status. Is there any way to purchase miles to reach the next level? Happy New Year!
@Delta stuck in line in Montego Bay not moving very long flight time coming up HELP!!!
Hello, @Delta one of your gate agents in Atlanta called cops “pigs” before my flight. I just want to send a note thanking them for their superior service!
@Delta I a representative gave me a number to call regarding my MQD not being correct. I am international right now and I even with 001 prefix I can’t get anyone on the line. I just went over all my reciepts and spent my MQD and my MQM is showing met. Please Help! Thanks!
@Delta Hi connect on the Wi-Fi all right all right but onlineHow do I redeem the Wi-Fi I purchased on the Internet
Hey @Delta the addition of Cinnamon Toast Crunch to the sky lounge is appreciated at LAX. #feelingverydiamond
@Delta anything I can do to pay for MQDs to make my Platinum status? I'm only $97 short for qualification and the elevate promotion would require $1000. Please help!
@Delta I never received any notification about that or any other flight modification. What are my options? Could you provide any other telephone number to call to Delta in Querétaro Airport? I have more connections to take.
Great flight love @Delta how can I update my sky miles?
@Delta i almost feel bad for how much I have been tweeting at you, but the service lately has been incredible. Our flight captain, Pam on DL572 HPN to ATL might be an actually angel sent from heaven. We have been delayed 5hrs, due to a mechanical issue, and she has been (1/2)
@Delta just wanted to share what A horrible experience I just had with ur airline me &amp; my PREGNANT girlfriend arrived at our gate in jfk airport 15 minutes earlier &amp; were denied entry to the aircraft because “the gate had been closed”only to me met w horrible service from ur reps
@Delta My wife and I have sent the case number via DM at your request. We look forward to resolving this. Thank you
@Delta I love to travel with you guys. But I choose my seats when I bought the ticket and you change my seats 😒
Hey @Delta these on the runway delays are really fucking my plans today.
So @Delta how is our travel experience going? Left after 7am for a 6:25 flight departure to get into Detroit with 15 mins before our connecting flight leaves. We get to our gate 30 seconds after they close the passenger doors and you refuse to let us on.
Hey @Delta do you idiots even try to takeoff on time anymore Or have you built so much extra time into flights that you just say “eh fuck it, I know we have the largest connecting flight hub in the world, that who cares when our passengers make it!” Signed 1/400 pissed off ppl
Help @Delta ! I forgot to apply my eCredit to my purchase last night. 😭 Is there anyway to apply it still !?
Second flight in a row with broken @Delta entertainment system. I want a per flight feedback or rating system in the app.
@Delta How do you Connect to Wi-Fi when you’re ready by buy Delta website when you going for booking
@Delta I'm sorry, can you clarify? is it 11:59pm on 1/1 (as the day is about to end)? Or midnight on 1/1 meaning just as 1/1 begins???
Currently being ignored by @Delta about reimbursement for US plane delay causing us to miss the first day of our #honeymoon at #StRegis in #Bali #customerservice #CX
@Delta Yes, it’s $300 to get 2,000 miles. I need 136 and I think that I’ve given you enough money this year to make status.
@Delta a rep in November confirmed I would make medallion status this year and congratulated me, but I ended up with 136 mqm to go. I’ve been handed off to different people for two weeks now trying to fix, and there’s no exception? Shitty customer service to end the year.
@Delta Me too, really helped out more than i can express.
I’ve been sitting on the tarmac on a @Delta flight in Missoula, Montana for almost two hours. Woman sitting next to me has two small children. Stuff happens, but sheesh, deplane the flight if you’re going to be stuck for that long.
@Delta That’s what I figured, thanks for the quick response, Happy New Year’s!
@Delta Found a supervisor who completely changed my mind.
@Delta need help! I need flight confirmation please. DL7965 Your telephone numbers don’t work!
aye @Delta why did my ticket just jump up so high 🤧
@Delta so I am considering going home to SLC late tomorrow night instead of the 2nd but there is a snowstorm tomorrow. Would you guys pay for a hotel in ATL or not because it’d be a weather delay?
@Delta I haven’t booked a flight yet. My first txt was quite clear that I won’t book it without knowing and neither the delta app or the Expedia app list expedited security as a benefit.
@Delta if I’m flying first class out of Boston Logan does our tickets include expedited security? After having it once with Jet Blue I’ll never book without having it again. So fast. LMK.
@Delta If I booked a domestic flight at 2:39am ET on 12/31/19, until what time exactly can I cancel it? Is it 2:39am on 1/1/20 or is it 11:59pm on 1/1/20 or something else?
@Delta Yes! I will be glad to take a survey! The flight was a 10 plus!
@Delta airlines has a sensory room in the Atlanta airport for children it’s autism and wow, they’re doing big things. ❤️
Damn @Delta really drops the ball when flying international their #customerservice has been horrible. My son is currently in Paris with no medication for his asthma to top it off they made him check his personal luggage and then left in New York for two days SMH
@Delta we’re on flight 2246 from slc to bwi. Your gate agent has been really great about trying to get people into better seats. The four of us were all over, and he managed to get us together without us even asking. Great customer service! Thanks!
@Delta if you’re going to fly out of LAX TERMINAL 3 you need to provide a decent amount of Ladies bathroom facilities! This crush and line is unacceptable!!!
Hey @Delta where can I post and share the inflight safety video online?
This is why I'm fiercely loyal to @Delta. They get you where you need to go, with weather being the ONLY exception and they do it masterfully, with customer experience a priority.
@Delta I need 64 MQMs to hit silver status. Is there a way to just buy this many instead of spending $300 for 1,000 MQMs??
@Delta Just wanted to pass along a negative experience with Delta at Boston-Logan. The Delta curbside check in, ticketing, sky lounge were all horrible experiences. Worst Delta experience at any airport. Definitely not typical Delta experience
@Delta I would like to appreciate your employee Cedric ( I didn't get the second name) at your desk at international departures in Atlanta. I would have ended up stranded in Heathrow if he didn't care to find out about the Transit visa requirements. Thank you Cedric.
@Delta Good morning, I was on a flight from Naples, Italy to Norfolk, Virginia with stops at Paris CDG and Atlanta. I was informed that one of my checked bags went missing before I reached Atlanta. When I got to Norfolk, I filed a claim Friday, I heard nothing since.
@Delta never fails to surprise me with its lack of efficiency. Scheduled to depart at 8:40am, still sitting on the runway at 10:20am. Nice!
.@Delta thank you so much for calling the baggage courier last night! I think it really helped to have you intervene! I really appreciate the extra help!
@Delta it’s a shame you guys couldn’t help an elderly sick couple avoid a 12 hour layover without asking for 100k points - each person. Pathetic.
@Delta Last flight of the year and entertainment system not working. 4 hour flight back to ATL....just fantastic!
@Delta I was originally traveling with my family and had to take a separate flight home due to an emergency..as a platinum member I do not pay baggage fees. Since I had to leave early my family was charged for there bags. Was seeking a refund of those fees
@Delta I am trying to find out where to send my papers for my service dog, need help
@Delta Thanks - they’ve been saying that for 2 hours now so we’ll see... are you able to offer some sort of voucher for the delay?
Free movies on my way to SEA with time to finish it? Say no more. No time is wasted when I fly @Delta.
@Delta Stuck at FAR and MSP for over 2 days. Finally returning to IAH today. Cabin crew says they only give headphones for free when there are significant delays. My delay obviously not long enough. Charging me $2 is just a racket.
@Delta hi delta for a flight with a layover is it possible for you to change the date of the first flight to the day before? I already purchased the flight awhile ago thank yiy
@Delta it’s quite apparent that DTW can not handle small amounts of snow and you leave you passengers on the planet for 2 hours now waiting to be de iced. On top of that there are no services, no water vet Maybe you should move your hub elsewhere
Does @Delta have CSpan livestream so I can watch the Warren Boston speech on this flight?
@Delta Would love an update. The app says 9:35a departure which is clearly not true as we’re still at gate. Pretty unfortunate for how much money I paid for this flight!
@Delta I know that I designated an isle seat when I checked in. Wonder what happened to that.
@Delta I was wondering why Delta doesn’t have family pooling for mileage programs. I have this with Jet Blue so I don’t have to pay to transfer miles between my husband and myself. I realized that Delta charges to transfer miles even between spouses.
One last tarmac screwdriver for 2019 — thanks for another hell of a year @Delta
@Delta I just had to pay $56 in order to have my 3 and 4 year olds sitting next to my husband and I instead of next to strangers on an upcoming flight. How is it even allowed that toddlers aren’t always seated next to thier parents?!? #NOTFamilyFriendly
as a loyal @Delta member, i am super disappointed that i took a meaningless flight yesterday to satisfy the $93 i needed to spend to reach gold status, only for it to NOT work!? wtf i worked so hard to get to gold &amp; im not going to get it now...delta can you help me out or what?
I really want to be loyal @Delta but you make it so hard!! Back to the gate for maintenance... Will this flight make it to Cali before New Years?!? 😐😐😐
@Delta I love how you can reply quickly here but not when we actually message you!
@Delta is there a way to ONLY purchase segments and not have to bundle with miles and dollars? I’m looking at the Elevate Your Status information. Thank you!
@Delta do you even know what it is like to travel with two kids and two car seats at 6am? 2 of 3 of our little family have special needs. Do you even care? Or do you only show humanity for cute men who show up after a single mom and her babes?!
Miss flying @Delta because of the customer service. Y’all are the best!
@Delta However, the young man who walked up after me and my children must have impressed the supervisor Terez Albert in BTR, because somehow his bags were checked in onto the flight we were supposed to be on...in front of me and my kiddos.
@Delta Lack of customer respect! Stranded in an airport it’s cold overnight due to a fueling problem! After sleeping with kids on the floor our plane gets delayed again for staffing purposes! What do you show for it? Nothing! You need to make things right!
@Delta I have always loved flying with you. Until today that is. You refused to take our bags on our 6am flight, saying we missed the cutoff for our bags and carseats to be checked by 1 MINUTE! This caused us to be rescheduled and my two children to be in hysterical tears.
@Delta, I am a loyal customer of yours. Always flying first class with you on a monthly basis basically. How your employees have handled this last trip makes me never want to fly with you again!
@Delta I’ll be providing feedback via direct message.
@Delta could you wish Arjun Jindal on DL 4896 at 9:10am from CVG to BOS “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!” ?!
I’ll never fly @Delta again. Smh
Hey @Delta? *boards my flight hoping we're not mistaken for fireworks on New Years*
@Delta this morning was stressful- weather delays and worries about making connections. I'm so thankful for the two Twitter agents that responded quickly and courteously to this momma's inquiries. Thank you so much. Praying for safe travels for the last leg of this trip.
@Delta can you tell me why a 16 year old traveling without his dad who has the same last name was not allowed to use his dads credit card? #Ridiculous
S/O to @Delta for always treating me well. Waiving change fees to accommodate tough travels over the holidays is appreciated. 👏🏼 #KeepClimbing #ConsumerFirst #SkymilesLife
@Delta we officially have a rap beef.
A Shout of encouragement to any fellow last minute crazy @Delta mileage run folks today- you can do it! #mileagerun
got my seat upgraded to the front on my @Delta flight AND have a whole row to myself. atlanta here i come!
My son has been waiting at the carousel for over 45 minutes for #SunCountry to deliver his luggage. As I sit &amp; wait in the car staging area I’m reminded why I fly @Delta, they are so much more efficient!
@Delta Travelling New York to Seoul via Boston, flights booked with Korean Air, first flight is with Delta. Please can you tell me if baggage will be transferred by airline or will I need to collect it then check in? Thank you.
#Bingewatching is the only way to do LAX &gt; SYD on @Delta. Thousands of hours of free entertainment, no sleeping necessary.
@Delta i am trying to check in for a flight tomorrow but each time I've tried to submit my details, it comes up with an error message saying oops. Any other way to check in before we arrive at the airport?
@Delta Hi Delta folks!! Happy New Year!! This is question for perhaps another time given how busy you are today but I have a question about my AMEX Skymiles and how I earn miles. Can you point me to the right place? Thx.
@Delta I have an accent, I’m filipino, but during dinner service she asked me what I want (after the whole “special food incident) she keeps repeating — you want JAPANESE? JAPANESE? JAPANESE? To which I replied “YES”each time just to end the dinner service. That’s humiliating.
@Delta flight attendant on our flight DL6 from Haneda to LAX (4:25PM) has been rude. she raised her voice when I took too long to pop up my tray, then she threw the cloth on top of my tray. Then she insisted that I pre-ordered a special food!? Like wtf are you talking about?!
@Delta They gave me the option to move up when I was booking...is there a chance they will offer that again?
@Delta I booked a basic economy flight from SFO to Rome in March. Since then I've gotten the Reserve card, and I wish I had booked main cabin so I'd be eligible for upgrades. Is there a way I can still move to a main cabin fare?? TY!
@Delta yeah when i check in it says to new york, but my boarding pass they send me at the end says to Atl which is my layover. trying to ensure i can get in second leg...
@Delta ok thank you. it’s the same number for both legs and i only got one for the first leg
That reminds me, thanks for a wonderful flying experience this weekend @Delta
@Delta Sent. Huge debt of gratitude to the first class team on DL2716.
@Delta i don’t usually fly with you. for second leg, it said choose seat. i had to pay at least $50 for a seat then. was that optional upgrade or did i have to do that? already paying premium as southwest canceled me
i know i’m not the first to say but @Delta has issuesssss #oversold
@Delta i have a two part flight, but only got my boarding pass for the first leg? i had to buy a $50 extra seat for second leg so i know it’s confirmed, but how do i get that pass?
Wow @Delta my flight gets delayed because the pilots chair needs maintenance what a great way to start my trip. The fact that my seat wouldn’t decline and my a/c doesn’t work make this a miserable travel experience.
@Delta is there any way to thank a flight attendant directly or at least make sure the thanks is passed along? ♥️ ✈️
@Delta 2/2 Was supposed to get back to SEA today at 10:45a plenty of time for NYE festivities instead I'll get back at 10PM! 😡What a waste of PTO and a horrible end to 2019. I guess this is what a $700 flight and Medallion status gets you. #deltamoments #nodelta2020
@Delta 1/2 Can you please explain why you're delaying flights by😡 7hrs &amp; 56min 😡 out of MKE for "weather" when it's not even snowing? Now I'll miss my connection and the only alternative flight has an 8hr layover on top of the delay! #deltamoments #nodelta2020
@Delta Whoever replied to this tweet needed to be informed. I live here and the loss of GC shouldn't be a reason to leave a passenger in a foreign land. CBP are the ones to deny or accept the entry.
If @Delta can get me to Honolulu on scheduled time (4pm) this New Years Eve.. I will not fly with any other airline when I’m in the states
@Delta at any point tonight are you going to take care of the passengers from flight 2467? Absolutely ridiculous how they've been treated.
@Delta dl31 right now... Premium select bulkhead remotes not working again. Same thing flying over. FA says resetting ife won't help, despite showing them your tweet directing that. Still on ground. Help. Paid for premium product not being delivered
@Delta stop trying to spin your bare minimum service into a positive. there aren’t enough seats on the bus and you turned a routine flight into a half day journey. I need my money back
@Delta I’m in LAX after we were supposed to land in SAN on DL2467, an equipment malfunction delayed us past SAN being open and now we’re waiting for buses, gate agents have almost zero information. what is going on
@Delta has the worst customer obsession. I thought United was bad but Delta has taken the cake as being the most greedy, least helpful and worst technology system airline. #constantwasteoftime #constantwasteofmoney
@Delta delivered a big FAIL today. Flight 2467 MSP to SAN 2hrs late from MSP, eventually diverted to LAX after SAN closed at midnight. At close to 1AM, all passengers to SAN to be provided ground transportation! What a class act!
@Delta - I would like to have someone contact me regarding Case 03298258. It is disappointing that you will not honor miles from a Business class ticket on Vietnam Airlines. You are 546 MQMs away from losing a loyal and valuable customer.
Thanks for stranding my wife in Los Angeles @Delta .
@Delta VERY late leaving SEA on flight DL0302 to JFK connecting with a terminal change to DL0461 to SXM. How about pulling that porsche around for this diamond and family so we dont miss our connection? Our 1.5 hour layover will maybe be 15 minutes now.
@Delta No idea. This was last year. I do know it’s how John Denver died.
@Delta NYC to PARIS. Wonder why: 1. Boarding pass did not have the seat assigned. 2. Why were 3 of the 4 agents at the gate so rude? It took the 4th, an African American to step in look at their screen and give me my seat number in 5 seconds! 3. Flight departed with 8 seats vacant!
From Phoenix to Seattle directly on @Delta we were routed to SLC with the claim the bathroom was broken. Pilot slipped and shared they forgot to refuel in PHX. WTF!?! Check the gas gauge. 3 hour delay. #FlightDelayHorrorStories
@Delta The guy on flight DL1099 to Incheon arriving at 4:30pm KST sitting somewhere around 51J should be banned from all flights for yelling at the people in front to "get off the fucking plane now" and chanting "left foot, right foot".
@Delta y’all broke three pieces of luggage. Thanks!
@Delta Is there a reason why you can't get a whole can of soda?
@Delta I had a very disturbing experience with Delta. Could you please reach out to me at the earliest. I’ve been trying to contact you since two weeks.
@Delta Will this change get me to Norfolk sooner than 10AM?!
@Delta I emailed comments and concerns over a week ago and asked for a reply but have not yet received one. Skymiles # 9052944601. Please reply to email.
@Delta No I am not. I live two hours from the airport and notice it when I picked it up out of my car. luckily I spoke with a nice lady on the phone who helped me figure out what I need to do. I expect better service from this airline since it’s the only airline I fly!
@Delta Why was flight 2555 diverted to Baltimore? We couldn’t even leave the plane due to a malfunction and now the flight attendant is telling us we need to find hotel rooms?! When is the next available flight to ORF? Ridiculous.
@Delta not to mention I’ve been on hold for 13 minutes. I dont want to speak with a robot. I want to speak with a humanbeing.
@Delta I am very angry at the moment. I got off my flight from LGA➡️ SYR at 11:30 My luggage is damaged. This is the second time this has happened to me I let the first one go because i always fly delta. This is the second luggage bag that has been damage &amp; I’m Infuriated.
@Delta why is there no staff here telling us what’s going on?
@Delta DL1212 is filthy and lots of inop stuff! This is the worst first product I have flown in all year with Delta. Long haul should be better than this. It's ok to do better.
@Delta standing on a jet bridge at LAX waiting for a bus to take us to Bradley. Never been stuck on a jet bridge getting off a flight.
@Delta it would be nice to see some metal cards along with the updates coming January 30 2020
With one day left in the year I made it to Diamond Medallion! Thank you @Delta where should i go next?
Looks like I'm flying the 1st because I won't make my connection again today. Fuck @Delta.🖕
@Delta this is my first time ever having an airline lose my bag and have no answer for where it is.
@Delta you’d think after a 10hr delay and 1hr 45min in the air RDU would have a crew ready to pull us into the goddamn gate at 1:45am #serverlydissappointed
Hey @Delta not only did the TV on my flight not work, but my luggage was left in Atlanta!! Soooo happy flying with you guys 😝 #neveragain
.@Delta We just got shamed by the check-in guy. “If you call in to Delta to complain, they call us and we all wait longer!”
Thanks to @Delta for getting my mom to us tonight even with all the delays at MSP. Would not have been good for her to be stuck overnight and they saw that and made it work!!
And now @Delta flight 1989 is delayed and the connection in DTW is near impossible. Could have gotten home and given you more money.
Instead, this year @Delta at least opts to notify us 7 hours in advance: 11pm at night before an expectation of being at the airport by 4am. That’s an improvement, but who are they expecting to be awake (w/ a toddler) at 11pm for a 4am airport arrival to manage their flights? 😡
@Delta really got my luggage in no mans land. Thanks for once again misplacing my shit.
Combine this with the fact that last year, @Delta did not notify us of this change until *after* when we were required to be at the airport, before anyone was even at the counters.
For the 2nd year in a row now, @Delta has cancelled/seriously rescheduled (4h+) our MOT-&gt;MSP flight. This is…problematic, to say the least.
@Delta please explain why the SD reps you give active duty a hard time. In one duty day I work an avg person’s work week. A girl is tired, hungry &amp; literally just wanna see my family I haven’t seen in months and I won’t see again for a year bc I deploy.
@Delta DL3722 on December 28th 👍🏻
I tried to pay you more money @Delta but you got greedy. Priced a 1 way ticket for $598 this morning in first class for a direct but you wanted $359 to change a ticket I already paid over $1000/ea for round trip. I would have paid you something but for two people and $700+?
@Delta Every time you have tried to help me today you have made it infinitely worse. I'll pass.
@Delta Can I pack my sons walkie talkie toys in my carry-on backpack?
Shoutout to BZN Gate Attendant Floyd for making a frustrating travel day with delayed flights and possible missed connections better by helping everyone have a plan b! @Delta - this guy deserves a raise!
To top off the worst day of flying in history, it appears @Delta now lost my luggage. 15 hour delay and no food voucher provided. No taxi voucher to hotel. Worst experience of my life
@Delta No, i moved quickly from the deak to avoid a confrontation.
Rats. Left a package on the plane. I called and left a msg with the cleaning crew and filled out a lost item form. What are my chances I will see it again, @Delta ? 🤞
@Delta has lost my luggage. I flew from Detroit to Seattle on the 27th. I made a claim 3 days ago and was told each day my bag would arrive to my door within 12 hours. My bag has not arrived and I’ve been told it’s in Detroit. No one will answer there. Delta please send me my bag
Just wanted to reiterate how much I truly dislike the @Delta Twitter team. Completely useless. Someone in a DM just told me to go "talk to customer care"...so what the hell are they exactly??? USELESS.
it took a bunch of extra time.. but I'm back in Cleveland! thanks for getting me here in one piece despite the snow storm and winter weather, @Delta!
Whew. @Delta is in our DMs wasting our time. Don’t ask us what’s going on — then dismiss what we reported. NEVER. FLYING. DELTA. AGAIN.
@Delta extremely disappointed with your service today. Flight DL5519 landed at 6pm at BTV to sit on the plane for hours before getting off to sit in airport for hours being told false information only to eventually get delayed until the AM. Very frustrated
@Delta GM here needing help with rebooking. Got a notice about a severely delayed flight. Can you help?
@Delta send me some cookies 😩
PS, every time I fly #NotDelta I'm reminded of how good their customer service actually is. I sometimes get rattled but they're the class of the bunch. #Delta @Delta #GoldMedallion
@Delta having an absolute nightmarish experience with your customer service reps and baggage system. I need help remedying this issue and so far, I could make 3 albums with your hold music and have been transferred continuously with no answer!!!!!
Thanks Scott at @Delta baggage services in MSP. I so appreciated you helping end a long tough travel day (with a different airline who shall remain nameless) with so much positivity. Happy New Year and thanks again!
@Delta customer service needs to do a better Job ;wasting hours on the phone,miles and money and no solutions. Crazy
@Delta I get bad weather and appreciate the pilot looking out for our safety, but take care of us.
@Delta my reprotected flight to LSE just got turned back around to MSP. Rebook for just thing tomorrow morning. And I want a hotel.
@Delta - thanks for delaying us 6 hours and not guaranteeing any flights home for the next two days. Terrible communication and customer service.
@Delta Thank you I knew that
@Delta Thank you so much. I’ll arrive a little early tomorrow to sort that out. Thank you!
@Delta I think so? When I called they told me I didn’t qualify to alter my itinerary
Why the FRICK are airline companies allowed to cancel your itinerary if you miss a flight?? I flew back to MN a few days early to surprise my mom and called @Delta before hand to see if I could cancel/change my flight and they said no.
Missed the 8:30pm ATL to NY flight and @Delta asked me to pay $75 to get confirmed for a seat on the next flight or leave it to chance. I declined but ended up getting a seat on the same flight. Won fe gbe mi ni handicap.
@Delta When you have my luggage and drop it to a delivery company and no one answers your phones for 3 hours, how do I find out when I will get my bag?
#UnitedAirlines is the freaking worst!! 65 dollars for a carryon after spending damn near 900 on flights this holiday? II’ll stick with @Delta from now on!!
Oh nothing, just sitting on this flight for 2 hours and 20 min patiently waiting to take off. Mind you, I’m flying with a toddler &amp; 7 year old. @Delta 🤬
@Delta am I allowed to bring a TV in my bag
@Delta had some great attendants on my Detroit to MCI trip DL5882. A child was having a rough time behind me. They handled everything very well.
Call time: 2 mins 42 seconds. @Delta was able to find and cancel my reservation without penalty. The miles are already back in my account. Now that’s some amazing customer service.
@Delta Flight # DL2214. This is not the first issue I've experienced on this trip. From broken bathrooms, to a broken jetway, this is just the latest debacle I've had to endure.
@Delta Hi folks. Hope you're having an okay night despite everyone's frustration with the weather cancellations. I paid using miles for an upgrade in legroom on a flight today that was then cancelled and I was not booked Comfort+ on my next flight. Can I get those miles back?
@Delta A #deltamoment that makes a difference in a negative way is when you discriminate against pit bull type dogs. Not only did your legal department fail but so did your PR department.
4h flight delay ahahah @Delta knows how to make you happy this holiday season 🎉
STILL delayed on @Delta for seemingly no reason 🙃🙃🙃 losing my gourd y’all are my witness
@Delta Is there confirmation the bags were actually passed off to Icelandic air? I understand if you cannot track past that but was there confirmation of an actual hand off?
8:30 departure. It's now 10:00. Still on the ground. Still have to be de-iced. Another triumph of @Delta airlines. Fucking disgrace.
Yo @Delta I’m thankful for our relationship in 2019 and look forward to more flights in 2020. #bestairline #LIT #FLL #skymiles
Hey @Delta, thanks for making a deployed service member's wife pay for her luggage while she traveling visiting family... and then losing said luggage along the way. 🙄 Not a good look.
@Delta Don’t you wanna know my flight number? You should put this on his record or something
@Delta I would like you guys to know that on my flight I had a wonderful flight attendant and his name was Kyle. He was so kind and helpful!!
Shout out to the crew of @Delta Flight 318 tonight, RSW ➡️ MSP. That was a pretty smooth landing, especially in a winter weather advisory! 🙏
@Delta Sent. Pls have maintenance check it out.
@Delta They’re not doing anything to help her.
My travel rants continue - why should you load a plane only to make the people sit in the plane for 2+ hours? Why can’t we sit in the airport? This is so ridiculous @Delta!! At least offer a drink service...
@Delta Flight 1628 from PBI to ATL arrived almost 30 minutes ago, but bags not yet delivered to carousel. Are you able to provide an update on the delay?
@Delta Is there any particular reason that the charging seats in D terminal in ATL are not actually connected to any power source? #youcandobetter #goodcustomerserviceiseasy
Is there another company in any industry worse than @Delta airlines? Nothing but failures on every leg of my journey.
Thanks @Delta for telling us our flight was canceled after getting up at 2:30am and sitting on the runway for an hour.After buying new tickets at extra cost of $2000 they said flight was delayed to save money.Could not offer me a solution to get me to Dallas the same day.
@Delta We filed in person a lost baggage claim. Yesterday morning. When we arrived. And we had no bags.
.@Delta I’ve been waiting for bags from EWR for a full day now. Please please please help me!!!
@Delta your gate agent in Atlanta, Gate D8A, refuses to do his job. In addition, he is rude and sarcastic.
@Delta How can I get help with my baby’s stroller that was damaged on a Delta flight? P.S. I’ve tried the waiting on the phone for hours way already.
@Delta Amazing customer service when we had a medical emergency and needed many flight changes. #DeltaAirlines you were amazing and my new number one choice in airlines. Many Thanks
@Delta flight #2755 has been sitting at the gate for 55 minutes. It’s been unloaded and I got a notification 50 minutes ago that my bag has been loaded. So why aren’t we starting the boarding? If you’re going to delay us, at least have the courtesy of communicating with us.
My girlfriend boarded her flight 30 minutes late, then sat on the flight for two hours only to taxi back to the gate. This was all for a quick flight from MSP to Omaha. Do better @Delta!
@Delta Can you please check by name on that same date? Is that possible?
@Delta How do we go about getting the refund?
After hours on the tarmac at BDL, finally landed in DTW. Where my connecting flight is gone and @Delta won’t cover a hotel since weather isn’t their issue. I get 24 hours of travel back to Seattle, and another connection tomorrow. #WhyIDontFlyDelta
@Delta my 3 year old is going to bed crying since the suitcase with his pillow didn't make it home with us. We had a 2 hour delay, how did the bag not make it into the plane? And when was I going to be notified about this - I waited like an idiot at baggage claim for 20 mins.
@Delta WTH is going on #DL1878 has been sitting waiting to deplane for almost and hour. R u going to do something?
@Delta I was happy how our travel ended yesterday. Now I'm concerned with the computer issues that may affect my travel on Wednesday morning.
@Delta Or reimburse her for what she’ll need for the night if you deliver it tomorrow.
@Delta The 4 passengers are me (owner of the Amex Platinum so I have complimentary access), my wife (charged), daughter Emma (she is 3, charged) and son Tomas who is 3 months old (so no charge).
Horrible holiday flight story? @Delta this is not one of them.
@Delta Thanks. But it was only my wife and daughter. It needs to be only one $58 charge instead of 3
@Delta Or pay for the Lyfts since she has to go back to the complete mess that is the NOLA airport.
@Delta spoke w 2 reps re:trying not to lose Medallion as a result of immediate family w cancer (canceled Dec travel, traveling early Jan). They gave conflicting info about what I can do. One said til Jan 31 flights count, other did said it doesn't...?
@Delta My IFE is not working (flight 1193 seat 12c). Made for a boring trip :(
Nice job @Delta putting my sister’s luggage on the wrong plane then forcing her to pay for a Lyft both ways because you’ll only deliver it if she’s at a hotel. It was YOUR mistake!
@Delta why TF am I sitting on a plane, at the gate in DTW waiting to be released from captivity!!!
@Delta Hi thanks for your quick reply, looking forward to flying Delta my first time with yourself 👍
@Delta - If I purchased 2 comfort + seats and then you change the plane and it doesn’t have comfort * do I get a refund?
My claustrophobic daughter has been sitting on the runway in Minneapolis on @Delta having an anxiety attack and customer service says there’s nothing they can do. 😡
.@Delta if I "miss" my flight can I catch a later flight on standby? Also...are there any fees for standby?
Thanks @Delta for recognizing your loyal flyer with first class upgrade.
@Delta oh please help me! 44MQM’s to Gold, and my flight from Boston so delayed I had to take a train home! Please have mercy. How can you help?
@Delta According to the rep at the club they patched one through under my name Camilo Atuesta. But kept asking who Camilo de Greiff was (my card has both my last names)
Been sitting on a @Delta plane for almost a whole hour waiting to take off... absolutely ridiculous
Anyone flying @Delta through 1/31 that wants free drink tickets? I have several expiring I would love to give away
Great job @Delta for fabulous flights PBI to ATL to SDF 12/25 and again on our return SDF to ATL to PBI 12/30. Ticket agent Holly at SDF today was amazing!
@Delta Is there a reason why I was charged for this bag to get delayed this long? So, there’s a fee to keep my bags from me now? Come on, it’s been 10hrs and still no solution folks
@Delta GLVCKO. do not have SM number
Thank you @Delta for awesome holiday travel. Not the easiest thing to work over the holidays. We really appreciate it.
@Delta what does gift card status "closed" mean?
@Delta Thats my statement and ut has already posted to my account! They do not show a 006 number anywhere. I called my bank and they have no idea what these are. That’s why I say if this is a US specific thing.
I don’t know what kind of sorcery is going on with these two pilots on my LAX -&gt; DTW @Delta flight (2082), but they’re the friendliest pilots I’ve ever had. They’re chatting up everyone! I’d like to add that they’re always friendly, but these guys are extra! 👏🏻 #delta #pilots
Pray that I can make my connecting flight still as I sit at the gate in MKE Please @Delta have flight 2492 wait for meeeeeee
Today’s @Delta documentary recommendation: “Once Brothers,” the 30 for 30 on Vlade and Petro. Those two plus Kukoc and Dino Radja made one hell of a lineup for the former Yugoslavia.
@Delta You changed my boarding pass as I scanned it while boarding and broke up my family. I selected this seat months ago when I booked my flight. I’m a silver medallion member. Explain?
Good to know @Delta bait and switches it’s customers. Then tries to “compensate” you to keep you quiet #NewYearsEveEve
Walking towards baggage claim after my final flight of 2019 with my claim ticket in hand because according to my @Delta App my bag never made it on the aircraft. 🤞🏼 Here’s to hoping that it just never got scanned! #FingersCrossed
@Delta Really? I will send you some screenshots later.
@Delta Already done, a Customer Care Rep reached out but didn’t leave any contact info in the voicemail or send an email.
Never ever flying @Delta again lol
.@Delta I'm at ATL and just witnessed at least 3 of your gate agents dealing with some major verbal harassment. Props to them for handling it like pros. They deserve recognition.
That time you’re sitting on your @Delta flight in Detroit after spending all day in the airport, but the first officer isn’t, because he’s stuck in Milwaukee, and now your flight is delayed an hour. HEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPP!!!!
@Delta Asia at ATL airport gate B29 flight to Newark is the best. Super nice and informative. I appreciate her taking the time to explain the Amex upgrade process. Now a happy silver Amex holder!
🥂 cheers to kicking off 2020 things in style and my first ever first class experience @Delta ❤️
@Delta That seems unnecessary. I was able to get boarding passes via my laptop. But, the mobile version of your website does not perform this function and I was wondering why not?
@Delta how the fuck do you board a plane knowing there are no crew dl4943!
@Delta my flights over 2 hours late taking off and I have half a seat to sit in, thanks to the 2 biggums next to me.... do yal consider charging people for more then one seat or expect me to pay for half their seat too?? #IfTheArmRestDontComeDownTheyTooBigToFit #TheFuck
@Delta why am I paying $495 for a credit card when I can’t access the sky club with my husband at no extra charge. United let’s us both in on the one card that I also pay a fee for. Not a happy customer.
@Delta Thats the problem!! How can I get them?? My bank (international) only has confirmation numbers and they are not 006 numbers. This number I got by one of your representatives who said that I should fax the Skyclub for more help! Fax? Really?
@Delta Very happy to have a free eye mask, free earphones, and the seat next to me unoccupied on this nine hour intercontinental flight. Kudos. 👍
@Delta two hours of delay because of a technical problem. Now your baggage claim is stuck. You have a baggage delivery guarantee time, right?
@Delta Someone from your aircraft cleaning crew stole my AirPods out of my purse.
@Delta I’ve been on hold for an hour looking for my lost bags from this morning. No response, no uodates, online says the file has been closed. Where’s my stuff??
@Delta I talked to customer service on the phone and they made things worse... the gate agent in Atlanta helped them out... you have severe communication and service issues
@Delta things so bad with the economy, yal charge 4 times the price for 1/2 of seat??? #Crooks #RapingYouRecords
@Delta I was at the SkyClub and entered with my AMEX platinum. Paid for my wife and daughter. I do not know the 006 numbers. The only one we could recover is 0060158287663 but the other 2 I do not know. They charged me under my name Camilo Atuesta and others as Camilo de Greiff
Seriously @Delta the Detroit airport is ruining your name. Been waiting on strollers to be unloaded for 30m— new fought is already boarding crew. Happens every time at Detroit.
I literally just paid $30 for WiFi on a damn delta flight from BOS-SLC. These @Delta prices are a damn racket. One day an airline will realize the gains to be had by offering free WiFi and corner the market.
I swear to god @Delta is really pissing me off today. Apparently they can’t be trusted to put a bag under a fucking plane. Such a complex task. Then their baggage people are exactly zero help
@Delta my best friend just wants to be in Ireland on schedule, please contact ASAP to her her flight fixed!!!
@Delta she should butt out. And make sure that boarding is not a free for all.
@Delta I received excellent service from a female representative of yours at gate 27A in ATL today around 715pm. She deserved the shout out!
@Delta my friend missed her flight to Ireland bc you wouldn't take cats that she PAID tickets for! Please contact ASAP!!!! She needs a new flight or a refund! Absolutely unacceptable to take money like that!!!
@Delta it is wholly inappropriate that a gate agent at FLL is telling my wife and I how we speak with each other. Or that she is threatening to take us off the plane for speaking in a low tone but excited manner. /1
didn’t have a seat assignment for my @Delta flight - they were oversold by 1 ticket and told me they’d give me $1000 and a free hotel night if I waited till tomorrow. last minute someone didn’t show up and they gave me a upgraded first class ticket. Never been so bummed out lol
Ugh it’s so annoying that @Delta doesn’t let green card holders do mobile check-in when they are out of the US. It is SUCH an inconvenience 😩😩😩😩😩
@Delta Hi just a quick question I'm due to fly with you from Edinburgh to JFK next week how can I add my luggage, it wasnt offered with the ticket I bought as it was economy. Can I do it before I get to airport or just pay when checking in? Any advice really appreciated. Thanks
Good thing @Delta didn’t check if both engines were fucking working before we were seconds away from takeoff
@Delta Sorry from DTW to Atl
@Delta Mechanical issues on 1604 to Detroit will cause them to miss 805 connection to PNS unless you can get them to wait
@Delta bag was supposed to then be on Flt DL1853 arrived at 6:45pm. Was told I would be contacted once my bag arrived. Lets get this Medallion member his bag please! 👊
@Delta can someone DM me, I’m trying to get my family on an earlier flight .
@Delta Big thank you to Derek at Global Support for helping me reroute an international passenger today. It wouldn’t have happened without his help and kindness!
Love that @Delta boards our military first!
@Delta can you assist with a change to a flight paid for with a companion certificate? Cant do it online.
Well, had a decent streak with you @Delta until today. Didn’t get my check in bag on my flight even though the APP confirmed that it was scanned to baggage claim. Still awaiting to see if it arrived on a later flight and have it delivered to me
@Delta i will and am going to be flying with them again. Great customer sevice! Helpful staff! I am 100% a loyal customer.
classic fucking @Delta delaying for 2+ hours right before taking off while we're on the tarmac
Landed an hour and 15 minutes ago on @Delta flight 2164. Still not off the plane. JFK is a huge airport. Was there really only one gate we could pull into?
@Delta I was charged 3 times for entering my wife and daughter to one of your SkyClubs in ATL. The lady passed my credit card three times saying it didn't go through and not did. And now my bank is charging me for it... nobody at Delta has helped me, nobody answers!
TFW you board a @Delta flight from Boston to Florida and your bag gets shipped to JFK in a different flight... Good things I have friends of the same size
Ok @Delta I see you 😊 Thank you!!!
I was told my only option was to pay for my dog to come on the plane as a pet. Meaning I had to find a crate to carry the dog on the plane. Cue me crying and running around the airport frantically looking for a crate. Thankfully the people at @Delta aren’t heartless.
@Delta delta gate areas at DTW are a total mess. It’s quite disgusting. I do not see anyone emptying trash or vacuuming. Assume this will be reflected in your surveys.
Thanks a lot @Delta for assisting me today with alternate flight arrangements. Really appreciate your efforts.
@Delta DL 2164 has waited 57 minutes and counting for a gate at JFK. Children and adults alike are miserable
And the winner after weeks of research and travel agents etc.. is @Delta for our trip to #Greece next fall. Super excited! Now Delta--please don't cancel the flights like my Iceland trip that got canceled haha. I TRUST YOU! #Travel #writerslife #research
@Delta flight 1820. Just witnessed a very professional flight attndt get berated for asking ppl to move coats to make room for suitcases. 2 men were emboldened by each other’s rudeness &amp; kept saying they can’t wait to write complaints etc. She was calm &amp; professional thru it all
@Delta I’m still waiting for my suitcase. You gave it to some company named #WheresMySuitcase and they are no where near me and definitely will not make the by 7:30 pm delivery time. What are you gonna do to rectify this matter?
@Delta What if I have the CC, you asked if I have one.
I’m wondering why @Delta insists on mimicking a hot oven on every flight 😭😭😭😭😭
@Delta can you pretty please cure my travel anxiety about my super tight connection by sending one of your car shuttles to take me to my gate? I PINKY SWEAR to give you all the social media loves. Promise. #Imnotbegging #kindof #DontMakeMeSprint
@Delta No I do not have any of those. I was considering getting a CC.
For one, @Delta, you should not be so dismissive of such issues from a customer service standpoint. I know you’re an airline and don’t care about customers but still, the point remains. I will remember this situation when booking my next flight. Again, not that you care.
@Delta i flew to mexico today direct from Cincinnati and landed at 1 pm and i still don’t have my luggage AFTER i paid $130 extra. i also can’t get a hold of the customer service line!!!! helppppppppp.
@Delta hmm, 2nd flight late, that's 2 for 2. Outbound late to the gate, late to get serviced, pilot and copilot late to fly the plane. Return flight, here we go again. #Late
@Delta Hi there! I’d need your help concerning a booking. DM? :)
I love flying @Delta with my ESA as they are so accommodating and understanding. Man next to me (DL 0517 seat 2C) on this flight has been sending 1200 chats to delta about how ESA is bullshit and how unfair it is he has to sit with me. Should I tell him I can read his chats?
My luck with @Delta been so bad today. The weather &amp; these plane maintenance issues have ruined this day for me...
@Delta I am 290 MQM short of platinum for next year but all I see is being able to purchase a bundle of 1000 or greater starting at $999 how can I just get 290 to elevate as $999 is a lot of money and I'm so close
Carly on @Delta DL3023 is AMAZING!!! Thanks girl! Amazing service. Just one of the many reasons #WhyILoveDelta
Flight 901 was failed by @Delta in every way possible today. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
@Delta everything about my current experience trying to get from LGA to MIA is wild trash. The attitudes from gate agents, to the delays bc of incompetence and miscommunication, very disappointing.
About to fly to Salt Lake City and back to LA in the next 8 hours, all so I remain diamond for 2020! @Delta, you are worth it and I’m happy to spend so many hours with you. #MQDrun 💎
Who do I need to talk to get my hat back? I left it on a plane @Delta
@Delta I’m currently traveling with Air France operated by Delta. My first flight delayed so I missed my second flight . I was put on a new flight and I’m obliged to spend the night at the airport. No accommodations provided , #G4YQ08 . Need someone to speak to. Thank you
Hey @Delta how much for a day pass at your airport lounges?
Free movies on my way to SEA with time to finish it? Say no more. No time is wasted when I fly @Delta.
Im a @Delta fan but I dont know if its RDU or Delta to blame for the 5 hour delay due to technical issues or departing then having to return after 10 minutes in the air due to the landing gear not going up. I changed my flight but since landing 4 gate changes have occured.
On a @Delta flight that just landed in Detroit with a passenger in the bathroom at touch down. Hope he's ok ✈️🚽💦
@Delta No. It asks if I want to upgrade or check bags (No to both). Then it says "You are checked in" without an option to print or text boarding passes.
When I really need @Delta to deliver a good travel experience for my parents they fail miserably.
Hey @Delta why did my husband and I get moved from our selected seats without any notification and then at check in it was too late to do anything on a full flight? He is 6’3” so we chose those seats for a reason.
I'll be spending the rest of 2019 filling out paperwork for my delayed luggage and all its contents that are completely soaked, filthy, stained and missing items. Thanks @Delta for a disgusting end to our trip.
The crew on DL1042 from ATL to NOLA are exceptional. I especially felt appreciated when a first class attendant thankee for my medallion status. @Delta just keeps getting better! #loyalty
@Delta What, no dna sample or first born? Lol. Dm on the way
@Delta When I click cancel on the website, it blocks me and says the flight cannot be cancelled because it's basic economy. So...sure.
@Delta You should have barbers in Sky lounges. I never have time to get a haircut, but always have 30 min to kill before a flight. Would be a great skymiles perk. Pilot it in Seattle, I bet the idea would take off!
Flights from MSP to GFK were cancelled so decided to drive up with a friend (still haven’t left). @Delta Baggage ladies told me, and my mom (over the phone) that my bags would be sent up on the next flight. A day later and they are still in MSP #disappointed
Aye @Delta y’all gone stop putting me on these peasant planes, I need in flight movies and WiFi. I didn’t go through random checks at tsa for this shyt, Rosa Parks aint die for this 😤‼️
127k @Delta MQMs this year. 100% were spent on site with customers or prospects (and a few trade shows). Can’t wait to start 2020 site visits. (FWIW I used award miles for a lot of flights this year as well). #skymileslife #diamondstatus #sales
Hey @Delta! Hoping y’all can help me with a question: If I have an existing eCredit, can I put it toward an upgrade on an upcoming flight? Thanks!
@Delta ?? I was not the one submitting a report.
I can understand @Delta not wanting to change or refund a basic economy flight, but not allowing people cancel is kind of dumb. I will not be on the flight. Wouldn't you rather know you'll have the open seat? O_o
@Delta I need my to be reimbursed for my upcoming flight that should have been waived. The representative was very unprofessional and showed me no empathy. I fly with you guys all the time. I’m very upset.
@Delta there aren't really more details. I can check-in from my phone using the link you emailed me, but I cant get a boarding pass. No problem doing it from my laptop. That is the entire story.
.@Delta hey seems like ivanka trump and elaine chao will be keynote speakers at CES, your CEO will be speaking there as well. totally unacceptable. #BoycottCES
Dear @Delta, thank you for making me feel like a second class citizen today! Getting a basic flight ticket doesn’t mean I’m beneath your otherwise “outstanding” service. I’m anti regulation normally but you truly made me reconsider today.
@Delta what happened to you? you guys used to be the best and now you guys are below average. too bad
. @Delta Flt 2685 Oh this is gonna be a fun flight -hour behind sched, haven’t taken off yet - and we’re not allowed to use the bathroom - because we “might take off” soon
Another delayed flight with @Delta ... come on. Places to be 😭😭
@Delta’s flight attendants are late but according to the pilot, we - the passengers - need to be “speedy” when they get here. Right. Okay.
@Delta why do you not board window seat first then aisle? Or back to front? Wouldn't it be quicker?
@Delta can we figure out what’s going on with flight DL1604? This is ridiculous
@Delta Of course....how do you think I know the claim number?
@Delta which one of the Sky Clubs at DTW are currently under renovation?
@Delta just wondering. Why are people who bring dogs on planes more important to you than people who are allergic to dogs? I just asked to be move and got an “oh well” from the flight attendant.
@Delta So you’re asking me to provide the luggage locater information in the public domain?
@Delta Wow, you take customer service very seriously (sarcasm)...
@Delta you're making a 9 hour flight from SEA-AMS even more unbearable with no A/C power and a broken in-flight entertainment. Very disappointed to say the least...
@Delta Also, neither of the 2 file reference numbers I’ve been given work... your website keeps saying to call the 1-800 number. I spent 2 hours on the phone yesterday with that automated “customer service” number and it was a complete waste of time
@Delta Why did I take the earliest flight of the day and my luggage is on the latest?
@Delta Having to miss out another year without my husband this New Years due to him being stationed in Germany &amp;army didn’t allow to come to the states not having enough for my flight over there either. 😞
@Delta good job over booking the flight already !
@Delta Mahalo for the upgrade on DL1149 to HNL yesterday! #comfortable!
@Delta scheduled flight tomorrow. Flu. 102.7 temp. Now what? Econo ticket.
Really looking forward to staring down the short people in the exit row as I board and then battling the person sitting in front of me with my knees if they recline. Thanks @Delta!
@Delta I don’t want any bullshit on my flight today.
@Delta what do you do when a passenger is allergic to dogs and Flight DL2083 has 2 dogs on the plane? Asking for a friend?
I have made it. S/O to the pilot and @Delta for finally getting me to the U.P. during this winter storm.
thought it would be fine to casually get drunk at the airport bar since my flight was delayed an hour and a half... then they reversed the delay??? pls @Delta PLS
@Delta what is the number for lost and found/left on board items at SeaTac? I have filed a claim, but would like to speak with someone. Thanks!
.@Delta doesn’t care about #childsaftey they thought it was ok to take apart our car seat and reconfigure the straps the wrong way! They also tore the foam inside and then tried to hide it. Now they refuse to let us file a claim since we left the airport.
@Delta disappointed that my departure to ATLis delayed by pilots arriving at SNA, but you’ve got the best app in the industry which provides me with options. Well done.
How does the whole delta sky club thing work? We are flying first class from Sacramento to Orlando with a3 hour layover in Salt Lake City? Are we eligible? 🤷‍♀️ @Delta
@Delta I bought the Crave snack box and I think the meat/cheese might have been expired and it made me sick when I got off the plane. Can I be reimbursed please?
@Delta has the WORST service. My goodness 🙄🙄🙄
I get it, delays and cancellations happen like with everything. However, please do a better job updating your customers on the status. @Delta Gate agents saying, “I don’t even know what’s going on” is really poor communication.
Listen @Delta I don't know how the fuck you ain't gonna hold a flight for 30 mins since a lot of people and myself got our flight delayed. Take the L on the reviews today.
@Delta thank you, I would appreciate that if that is the best you can offer for this inconvenience. I would hope on future flights to be able to properly wash my hands and this isn’t a sign of typical cleanliness.
@Delta We have just dealt with a family tragedy and your rep O’Neal was so lovely to my mother in helping with our arrangements during this difficult time. This is the stuff that makes these things a little easier. Thank you O’Neal ❤️ #fromourheart #promotehim #thankyou
@Delta I received two travel vouchers from the same flight/mechanical issues you had but can't use both to book a new flight. Please help.
@Delta The poor ONE worker was amazing though, poor guy
@Delta Yes. And I needed unaccompanied minor services so that ONE person had to stop helping all the passengers bc we needed the special help. That took 15 minutes just for us. In addition I got charged the fee twice.
@Delta Really nice gate agent in Key West - Mitch. Thanks Delta! Thanks Mitch!
@Delta I'm on flight 469 from tlv to jfk Dec 30 sitting in seat 34j. The USB in my seat is broken. I'm screwed. Fix it 4 the next guy..
Maintaining your status on @Delta should be an Olympic sport. So close to hitting it and the only way is to spend THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS?! Insanity.
@Delta Help me get to Tokyo so I can spread the love 🙏♥️
@Delta your service has really decline!!!!
@Delta take a lesson from Virgin Atlantic- they know what to serve in their clubs- good food
@Delta Just did. Would be great to know your over serving policy as well?
@Delta terrible first experience on a plan to status match and change :(. DL 3683. Not a good omen.
@Delta will never see another penny from me!
@Delta ok , the food in your Skyclubs has sunk to a new low- LGA- salads no dressing, breads no butter, chicken no lettuce/dressing - not all of us like “kale Caesar salad...
@Delta Ha! I just reached the end of my patience with Delta. Thank god for in flight WiFi so I can research other airlines with better rewards and customer service. Maybe they will have on time flights too!
I have to say I was very impressed with the @Delta app the other day. My plane was delayed a half hour, the app warned me, showed me several other flights I could switch to for free and then changed my itinerary with a single click. I even got to my destination early. Good app.
@Delta I sent a private message before posting this and didn’t get anywhere. Flight attendant took my purse with all my money and passport, but let me keep my other bag. This isn’t about procedure, this was some funny stuff being done. That’s why I made it public. #frustrated
@Delta We have a family itinerary for an international trip that was booked yesterday that we are trying to cancel within the 24 hours. Unfortunately we don’t have access to the online account and we are waiting for Delta to call us back. Can you please help before the deadline?
Absolutely no one. Still at home. Not even out of bed yet. @Delta: Sir, you should consider checking that carry on.
@Delta BWI needs more ticketing agents! Long lines and one person working. One person for sky priority line! Crazy!
A flight with @Delta on Wed, too... not even w/ ya'll... &amp; I'm a Mileage Plus member. 😡😡😡😡😡
@Delta Sea airport is a joke for sky priority. The lines for it are longer then normal economy. What gives?
@Delta I think we’re past the point of no return
Thank you Jay at the @Delta counter in #IND for helping us avoid the weather mess in #MSP. 💯🙌🏽👍🏽
@Delta I have been courteous to your staff in Miami International, but it's incredibly frustrating to not receive any sort of compensation for having my travel day extended by over 15 hours when there were alternate flights available. Missed that chance due to waiting 1hr on hold
@Delta Thank you! I Saw it up in the app and everything. appreciate the help and hopefully this annoying weather will let up soon!
@Delta Thank you so much! really appreciate it! YOu guys are the best!
@Delta Customs where? In Beijing or in Sydney? How do you know it’s waiting to clear customs when Qantas claims that no one has found my bag?
@Delta I don't feel comfortable tweeting that! :-|
@Delta followup question... How to I get my checked bag since my transfer flight already left...? Can you hook it up with sky lounge sine I'm going to be here for 6 hours?
@Delta you guys are just the best! Thank you!
@Delta that's promising! Can I get on that one?
Get your shit together @Delta where the hell is my luggage?
How many people have a @Delta flight tomorrow for the sole purpose of completing the next-Medallion-level upgrade Asking for a friend
Hey @Delta - your gate agent Molly in Grand Rapids, MI., is killing it. She deserves all the kudos!
Hey @Delta is #4170 from RST to MSP delayed due to weather in Rochester, or the plane coming from somewhere else, etc? Just trying to figure out if I should try to get to MSP a different way to catch 5084 to CLE, or if we think the plane will actually fly from RST. Thanks!
@Delta can I make a recommendation? It might be helpful to have family restrooms in all Skyclubs, especially at ATL. As a father traveling with a 6-year old daughter, this would be sooooo helpful. Thanks!
(2/2) @Delta I’m going to need either A) my money back or B) those miles added to my card, as this was extremely unprofessional and UNSAFE for everyone onboard! Due to YOUR employees not properly inspecting the plane before takeoff, I missed a business appt that I had scheduled😡
Hey @Delta can we talk? After flying out of DTW all year, to the tune of 82k miles, being in your top 5% of flyers (you emailed me to tell me) I'm still 600 miles short of gold!? Your answer, spend another $599 to get 1000 miles. Seriously?
@Delta For the removal of any doubt... your DM was no help at all.
@Delta Done let's make this happen.
(1/2) @Delta I was on the 6PM flight 2754 on 12/29 leaving RDU to LAX when the pilot announces to everyone MID FLIGHT that there were maintenance issues and we needed to make an emergency landing in DEN😡my arrival to LAX was pushed back 2 HRS and I was extremely inconvenienced!
@Delta I'd really love to be able to check in for my flight. I had a 1 hour call this morning where a representative said my issue would be fixed an hour later. It is not. :)
@Delta Make sure my flight from MSP to LSE doesn't leave without me... We are stuck on a holding patter and that flight is scheduled to depart 30 min early...
@Delta never had an hour+ flight not have a beverage service like DL1918 today.
a few hours layover in Salt Lake City before making it to Houston. missed my connecting flight by 5mins in SLC, due to delay at SFO. thankful I made my 6am @Delta flight in San Fran, though. that was the true struggle, waking up at 3am. ✈️🙋🏾‍♂️
@Delta this ain't it today my guy.... just now departing around a time that I shouldve been landing in fayetteville had things gone correct. Stop giving Fayetteville NC the shitty planes! Do you really care about the veterans and family?!
@Delta Be kind to your employees, stop union busting!
@Delta Hi! I’ve booked a Delta flight via Virgin Atlantic. Comfort+ seatZ How do we select seats? Virgin website just says “contact the other airline”. I bet you can be more useful.
@Delta have to compliment Sherrelle (sp?) On the Platinum desk who helped me with an unexpected need to cancel a flight - awesome lady and was cut off before I could give her a 5 on the survey!
.@Delta can u help me more plz
@Delta They are supposedly looking in Miami - we need arrangements in Boston for our arrival
4th annual #NewYearsEve trip with my husband 🛫🍾🥂 what a year, what a decade! Happy #NewYear✨🙏 cc: @Delta
@Delta We are trying to make a connection. We let them know at the desk. Totally unacceptable
@Delta This is his personal wheelchair that was used to bring him down the ramp to board the plane. It was sitting just outside the main cabin door when we boarded
@Delta front end staff new hire failed to print our boarding passes, checking our bags and sending us on our merry way to security. Once there, we were laughed at for showing receipts that looked like boarding passes, sent back to the desk where the new hire laughed at us
@Delta Any future plans for direct flights from DEN-TPA?
@Delta I'm having issues with my booking, can you please help me out?
@Delta So basically you're saying I can have 6+ items that exceed reasonable overhead and under seat space but they will count as one because they're attached to a carabiners . But small 3 items that will fit under a seat is not acceptable. Great logic there.
@Delta Yeah especially since everything I need to do my job is in my bag. I’m going to have to cram in 3 days worth of work into less than one.
Dear Savannah, GA. Please stop kicking me while I’m down. @Delta lost my bag, Hotel lost my reservation...just a great Monday...
